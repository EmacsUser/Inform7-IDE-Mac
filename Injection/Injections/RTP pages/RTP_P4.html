Although Inform allows us to change the identity of the protagonist - the person through which the simulated world is seen and acted upon - only things of the kind <font color="#000080"><b>player-character</b></font> can be protagonists. Here, you seem to have tried to change the player to something which is not a <font color="#000080"><b>player-character</b></font>.
