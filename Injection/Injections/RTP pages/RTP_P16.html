<b>P16 - Can't remove nothing</b>
<p>
<p>Most problems are detected when Inform translates the source text, but this is one of the exceptions, a "run-time problem" which emerges only during play.

<p>
This problem occurs if a phrase tries to remove something from play which does not exist.<p>The most likely way for this to occur is if a plausible name has been given to what is, most of the time, indeed a genuine thing - but not always. For instance, if we say <font color="#000080"><b>let the heroine be the tallest woman in the Amphitheatre</b></font>, supposing that we have defined <font color="#000080"><b>tall</b></font> and made such a place, then we might expect that <font color="#000080"><b>remove the heroine from play</b></font> would always work. In fact it would fail if there were no women in the Amphitheatre at the time we tried to set <font color="#000080"><b>heroine</b></font>, and this is the problem message which would appear.
