<p>
<p>Most problems are detected when Inform translates the source text, but this is one of the exceptions, a "run-time problem" which emerges only during play.

When we write a phrase 'To decide which K is ...', where K is a kind such as <font color="#000080"><b>door</b></font> or <font color="#000080"><b>room</b></font>, say, any use of 'decide on X' inside the definition of that phrase must result in X being the appropriate kind of thing. Here, X turned out to be an object, but an object of the wrong kind.
