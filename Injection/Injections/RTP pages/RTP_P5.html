<b>P5 - Relations cannot be used outside their defined roles</b>
<p>
<p>Most problems are detected when Inform translates the source text, but this is one of the exceptions, a "run-time problem" which emerges only during play.

<p>
When a relation is defined, it has to say which objects are allowed to be related: for instance, <font color="#000080"><b>Propinquity relates various rooms to various rooms</b></font> indicates that both of the objects involved in the relation must be rooms. It would make no sense to declare that a container and a person now satisfy the relation, and the attempt would be rejected by a run-time problem like this one.<p>More is true: it is not even allowed to test the relation for objects which do not meet its qualifications. So if we define the adjective <font color="#000080"><b>homely</b></font> to refer to any room which satisfies the propinquity relation with a special room called <font color="#000080"><b>Home Base</b></font>, say, then we are allowed to <font color="#000080"><b>say the list of homely rooms</b></font> but not to <font color="#000080"><b>say the list of homely things</b></font>.
