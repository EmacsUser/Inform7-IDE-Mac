The special value <font color="#000080"><b>nothing</b></font> is used to mean no object at all, and sometimes appears where an object might be expected if it was impossible to find a genuine object, or no genuine object was specified.<p><font color="#000080"><b>Nothing</b></font> is not an object in its own right, and so it makes no sense to look at its properties.
