<b>P28 - Attempt to test "in ..." for a non-room or region</b>
<p>
<p>Most problems are detected when Inform translates the source text, but this is one of the exceptions, a "run-time problem" which emerges only during play.

The special condition <font color="#000080"><b>in R</b></font> can only be used if R is a room or a region, and it test whether the current location of play is that room (or in that region). So it makes no sense for R to be some other kind of thing. This mistake tends to occur because the author assumes that something else is implicitly meant rather than the current location - for instance, one might write <font color="#000080"><b>if in player, ...</b></font> thinking that this meant some item currently under discussion: in which case the current run-time problem will occur with <font color="#000080"><b>yourself</b></font> as the thing which isn't a rule or region.
