<b>P20 - Attempt to look up a non-existent column in the table</b>
<p>
<p>Most problems are detected when Inform translates the source text, but this is one of the exceptions, a "run-time problem" which emerges only during play.

Suppose there are two tables, the <font color="#000080"><b>Table of Fruits</b></font> and the <font color="#000080"><b>Table of Fowls</b></font>, and suppose that the former has a column called <font color="#000080"><b>seeds</b></font>. Inform will (mostly) translate a request to talk about the <font color="#000080"><b>seeds entry</b></font> in a row of the <font color="#000080"><b>Table of Fowls</b></font>, but such a request can't make sense: the other table has the <font color="#000080"><b>seeds</b></font> column but this one doesn't. This problem will be detected at run-time, and this is the message which then appears.
