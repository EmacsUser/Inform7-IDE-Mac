<body><font face="lucida grande,geneva,arial,tahoma,verdana,helvetica,helv" size=2><b>Translating the Source - Ran Out of Space</b><p>
The application ran your source text through the Inform 7 compiler, as usual, and it found no problems translating the source. This process results in what's called a &quot;story file&quot;, which is a program for a small virtual computer. Unfortunately, the story file for this source text was too big for that virtual machine: there's just too much of it.
<p>
Inform can produce story files for several different virtual computers, and the one used by the current project can be selected using the Settings panel. If you are currently using the &quot;version 5 Z-machine&quot;, try trading up to version 8. (For instance, two of the worked examples on the Inform website are large enough that they can only be compiled to version 8.)
