<p>Inform allows us to perform arithmetic on units only where that would make sense, and it keeps track of the results. For instance,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('The Weighbridge is a room. &quot;A sign declares that the maximum load is [100kg multiplied by 3].&quot;\n\n\n')"><img border=0 src=../doc_images/paste.png></a> The Weighbridge is a room. &quot;A sign declares that the maximum load is [100kg multiplied by 3].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>...will produce the text &quot;A sign declares that the maximum load is 300kg.&quot; Here Inform knows that it makes sense to multiply a weight by 3, and that the result will be a weight. Similarly, Inform allows us to add and subtract weights, and several different forms of division are allowed:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('The blackboard is in the Weighbridge. &quot;A blackboard propped against one wall reads: \'122 / 10 is [122 divided by 10] remainder [remainder after dividing 122 by 10]; but 122kg / 10kg is [122kg divided by 10kg] remainder [remainder after dividing 122kg by 10kg]; and 122kg / 10 is [122kg divided by 10] remainder [remainder after dividing 122kg by 10].\'&quot;\n\n\n')"><img border=0 src=../doc_images/paste.png></a> The blackboard is in the Weighbridge. &quot;A blackboard propped against one wall reads: '122 / 10 is [122 divided by 10] remainder [remainder after dividing 122 by 10]; but 122kg / 10kg is [122kg divided by 10kg] remainder [remainder after dividing 122kg by 10kg]; and 122kg / 10 is [122kg divided by 10] remainder [remainder after dividing 122kg by 10].'&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>When we visit the Weighbridge, we find:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A blackboard propped against one wall reads: &quot;122 / 10 is 12 remainder 2; but 122kg / 10kg is 12 remainder 2kg; and 122kg / 10 is 12kg remainder 2kg.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Whereas we are not allowed to divide 122 by 10kg: that would make no sense, since 122 is a number and not made up of kilograms. Inform will produce a problem message if we try.

<p>Liquids, and all substances that can be mixed or broken off in partial amounts, pose a challenge to model in interactive fiction. The following example is a simple one, but adequate for many scenarios.
<p>
<p>We start by assuming that all liquids in the game will always appear in containers. The player can pour liquids from one container to another, and the containers keep track of how full they are and describe themselves appropriately. The player can also refer to containers by content.
<p>
<p>Mixture, however, is not allowed, nor is it possible to put liquids on other objects, pour them out on the ground, etc. These ideas would require a more complicated set-up.

<p>Now we need a trick from a later chapter, which allows something to be described in terms of a property it has. This way, the story will understand not only &quot;pitcher&quot; and &quot;glass&quot; but also &quot;pitcher of lemonade&quot; and &quot;glass of milk&quot; -- and, indeed, &quot;glass of lemonade&quot;, if we empty the glass and refill it with another substance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand the liquid property as describing a fluid container. Understand &quot;of&quot; as a fluid container.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And now the scenario itself:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Porch is a room. The porch swing is an enterable supporter in the Porch. &quot;An inviting swing hangs here at the end of the porch, allowing you to enjoy the summer with a cool beverage, and watch your neighbor Ted mowing his lawn with the very last manual powerless lawnmower on the block.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The glass is a fluid container carried by the player. The liquid of the glass is milk. The current volume of the glass is 0.8 fl oz.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The pitcher is a fluid container in the Porch. The fluid capacity of the pitcher is 32.0 fl oz. The current volume of the pitcher is 20.0 fl oz. The liquid of the pitcher is lemonade.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Ted's Lawn is outside from the Porch. Ted is a man in Ted's Lawn. &quot;Ted has taken off his shirt, but still seems a bit oppressed by the sun.&quot; The description of Ted is &quot;He looks hot. In all senses.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After deciding the scope of the player: place Ted in scope.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of doing something to Ted when the player is in the Porch: say &quot;You can't really interact with Ted from this distance, except in the sense of eyeing him surreptitiously.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of giving an empty fluid container to Ted: say &quot;Yes, taunt the poor man, why don't you?&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of giving a fluid container to Ted when the liquid of the noun is milk: say &quot;Ted looks ruefully at the milk. 'Thanks, but I'm lactose-intolerant,' he says.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The block giving rule is not listed in the check giving it to rules.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if Ted is in the location
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if Ted carries a fluid container (called refreshment), try Ted trying drinking the refreshment;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise if a random chance of 1 in 3 succeeds, say &quot;Ted pushes the ineffective mower over some dandelions.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of someone trying drinking a fluid container:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the noun is empty
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try the person asked trying giving the noun to the player;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decrease the current volume of the noun by 2.0 fl oz;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the current volume of the noun is less than 0.0 fl oz, change the current volume of the noun to 0.0 fl oz;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The person asked] gulps down some [liquid of the noun].&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After someone trying giving something to the player:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;'Here,' says [the person asked], handing [the noun] back to you. 'Thanks, I owe you one.'&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end the game in victory.
