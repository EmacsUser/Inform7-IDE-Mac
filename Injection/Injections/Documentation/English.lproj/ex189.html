<p>
<p>Interactive fictions vary considerably in the extent to which the player is allowed to influence the story-line. Sometimes the appearance of making choices is wholly bogus, as only one possible line is given more than lip service. But in other works, the player can radically change the outcome, and whole rafts of plot differ between one person's experience and another's. Inform allows multiple endings to its scenes to make this kind of branching story-line easy to achieve.
<p>
<p>Any scene can have up to 8 alternate endings, differentiated by name. These are created as and when conditions are set for them:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Brief Encounter ends happily when ...
<br>Brief Encounter ends wisely but sadly when ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Ends happily&quot; and &quot;ends wisely but sadly&quot; behave just like &quot;ends&quot;. We can have rules &quot;When Brief Encounter ends happily, ...&quot; and so forth, in addition to rules &quot;When Brief Encounter ends, ...&quot; - if a rule doesn't specify any particular ending, it applies to all of them.
<p>
<p>We can also link rules together from these branches, so
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Stranger's Acceptance begins when Brief Encounter ends happily.
<br>Stranger's Rejection begins when Brief Encounter ends wisely but sadly.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>With this set-up and that of the previous section, there are now two possible paths through the story:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">(i) Train Stop - Brief Encounter - Stranger's Acceptance - Bittersweet Ending
<br>(ii) Train Stop - Brief Encounter - Stranger's Rejection - Bittersweet Ending
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We might later need to know which of these paths has been taken, and to help with this Inform provides conditions like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if Brief Encounter ended happily ...
<br>if Brief Encounter ended wisely but sadly ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(For a scene which repeats, note that these conditions apply only to the most recent repetition: and that such conditions are always false if the scene is currently going on.)
<p>
<p>This chapter began by observing that, in the part it plays in stories, time is like space. The endings of a scene (along with its beginning) are like the map connections leading out of a room. The Scenes index keeps track of the &quot;map of time&quot; through which these possible story-lines traverse. Some works of IF will have immensely complicated story-lines in only a few rooms, some will have no scenes at all despite a sprawling geography. The Scenes and World index tabs, side by side, show both kinds of map.

<p>Suppose in addition to our pathetic little family history, we have another secret to convey to the Princess, this one a little more peculiar. She either gets it or she doesn't; once she gets it, we do not revisit that flashback, though it is still possible to keep visiting the poverty flashback.

Discovery begins when play begins. Discovery ends when Sleeping Beauty is awake. Marriage Proposal is a scene. Marriage Proposal begins when Discovery ends.\n\nWhen Discovery ends: say &quot;Throughout the palace you can hear the other sounds of stirring and movement as the spell of centuries is broken.&quot;; now Beauty is passive.\n\nInstead of waking an awake person: say &quot;Redundant.&quot;\n\nInstead of waking an asleep person: say &quot;Yes, but how?&quot;\n\nInstead of waiting in the presence of an asleep person (called snorer): say &quot;You are alone with the sound of [the snorer] snoring sonorously.&quot;\n\nInstead of attacking an asleep person:\n\tnow the noun is awake;\n\tsay &quot;[The noun] sits bolt upright. \'Hey!

You nod politely.&quot;\n&quot;marriage/love/wedding/boyfriend/beau/lover&quot;\t&quot;\'So,\' you say. \'This is a little weird since we just met, but, um. Would you like to get married?\'\n\nShe looks at you nervously. \'Do I have to? I mean, I\'d rather not.\'\n\nWell, this could get prickly fast.&quot;\t&quot;\'I, er,\' she says. \'I hope I\'m not supposed to marry you or something.\' Uh oh.&quot;\n&quot;marriage/love/wedding/boyfriend/beau/lover&quot;\t&quot;\'I was told I was going to marry you and inherit the kingdom,\' you say, apologetically. \'Would that be very bad?\' This could be awkward, considering your family circumstances -- you did promise your mother that everything would be better, after this --\n\n\'Oh, it\'s not you -- I\'m seeing someone,\' she says, smiling quickly.\n\nYou try to think how to point out that it\'s been a hundred years since she last saw her boyfriend.&quot;\t&quot;\'Do you think I could go look for someone? I\'m seeing him, you see, and I think I\'ve been... sick... for a while, so he might be worried.\'\n\nYou try to think how to point out that it\'s been a hundred years since she last saw her boyfriend. And try not to think how awkward things would be in your family if she refuses to marry you.&quot;\n&quot;marriage/love/wedding/boyfriend/beau/lover&quot;\t&quot;\'Do you think you could consider alternatives if he\'s no longer interested in you?\' you suggest.\n\nShe gives you the look of a wounded squirrel. \'My father might not approve of my love for the kitchen boy, but his heart is faithful and true!\' she exclaims.\n\n\'Right; supposing that he\'s still around, I\'m sure that his love won\'t have faded,\' you say, considering your fingernails. Maybe you\'d better come clean with her about your identity, after all: she might be more favorably inclined if she understood that you won\'t interfere in her base-born romances.&quot;\t&quot;\'I don\'t expect you to understand,\' she says in a low whisper. \'I know it is not considered proper for a princess to love -- and such a one as my William, who works in the kitchen --\' Her glance dares you to laugh. \'-- but I cannot marry you without telling you this truth.\'\n\nRight then. Perhaps you\'d better tell her your secret, in exchange?&quot;\n&quot;marriage/love/wedding/boyfriend/beau/lover&quot;\t&quot;\'You\'ve been up here for a hundred years,\' you say. An unpleasant thought occurs to you. \'Was your young man in the castle somewhere?\'\n\nShe shakes her head mutely.&quot;\t&quot;She goes to the window and looks out at the now-fading thicket of briar. \'That took a while to grow,\' she observes. \'I\'ve been up here longer than I thought.\'\n\nYou shrug, uncomfortable.&quot;\n\nInstead of asking an awake beauty about a topic listed in the Table of Conversation when Marriage Proposal is happening:\n\tnow Beauty is passive;\n\tsay &quot;[reply entry][paragraph break]&quot;;\n\tblank out the whole row.\n\nInstead of telling an awake beauty about something: try asking the noun about it.\n\nInstead of asking an asleep person about something:\n\tsay &quot;[The noun] snores.&quot;\n\nMarriage Proposal ends in failure when the number of filled rows in the Table of Conversation is 0.\n\nEvery turn during Marriage Proposal:\n\tif Beauty is active and Beauty is visible\n\tbegin;\n\t\trepeat through Table of Conversation\n\t\tbegin;\n\t\t\tsay &quot;[quip entry][paragraph break]&quot;;\n\t\t\tblank out the whole row;\n\t\t\tmake no decision;\n\t\tend repeat;\n\tend if.\n\nWhen Marriage Proposal ends in failure: end the game saying &quot;This is going to take some explaining.&quot;\n\nPart 2 - Flashbacks\n\nInstead of asking an awake beauty about a topic listed in the Table of Flashback Material:\n\tnow Beauty is passive;\n\tsay &quot;[reply entry][paragraph break]&quot;.\n\nA fact is a kind of thing. A fact can be known or unknown. A fact can be current or past.\n\nThe family circumstances is a fact. The secret identity is a fact.

Poverty flashback begins when family circumstances is current. When poverty flashback begins: strip the player; move the player to the Woodcutter\'s Shack.\n\nThe Woodcutter\'s Shack is a room. &quot;Your family lives in a shack in the forest. There are holes in the roof, and in the winter the snow comes in -- rain, too, for that matter. The walls aren\'t very well-boarded, and don\'t keep out the wind, and even though you live in the middle of dense woods, you can never gather enough fuel to keep this place fully heated. And then there\'s the stench. Pigs wander freely in and out, and your three youngest brothers play on the floor.&quot;\n\nPigs are an animal in the shack. The pigs are scenery. The description is &quot;They really are very grubby, dirty animals, but what\'s worse than that, the value of pigs has declined a lot over the last few decades. This is hard to explain to someone who has been out of touch with the world for a while, but keeping pigs for meat is a dubious prospect when there\'s less and less for them to forage on.&quot; Instead of smelling the pigs: say &quot;They smell the way animals do, when they live among their own refuse.&quot;; increase the pity of Beauty by 2.\n\nThe brothers are a man. The description of brothers is &quot;Hans, Franz, and Lukas. Twins and then the baby. So young, and growing up fatherless; and soon to be orphaned entirely, if your mother\'s health does not improve.&quot; Understand &quot;brother&quot; or &quot;twin&quot; or &quot;twins&quot; or &quot;baby&quot; or &quot;franz&quot; or &quot;hans&quot; or &quot;lukas&quot; as the brothers.\n\nThe untidy bed is scenery in the Shack. Mother is a woman on the untidy bed. The description of mother is &quot;She is wasting away of a slow disease, her skin stretched tautly over bone. She hasn\'t been the same since your father left.&quot; On the bed is a folded letter.\n\nThe description of the letter is &quot;Many times read over and creased, the letter explains how your father has gone away with a wealthy countess and will not return. Your mother was not able to read it herself, of course, and had to have it explained to her by the parish priest. Now she keeps it by the bed and crumples it in her fits of delirium.&quot;\n\nInstead of kissing or touching Mother for the first time:\n\tsay &quot;You place a gentle kiss on her feverish brow. She looks up at you, her oldest -- yes, never mind that bit -- with a look of sincere trust and admiration.\n\n\'You\'ll find a way through this for us,\' she says, squeezing your fingers. \'I know you will.\'&quot;; increase the pity of Beauty by 3.\n\nInstead of kissing Mother: say &quot;You have no more heart-rending memories of affection to recount; that one incident will have to serve, for rhetorical purposes.&quot;\n\nInstead of waiting in the Shack: say &quot;The wind blows sharply through the walls.&quot;\n\nInstead of attacking someone in the Shack:\n\tsay &quot;Though sometimes the conditions of your life make you grouchy and impatient, you would never dream of striking a member of your own family. But from time to time you do feel the temptation.&quot;\n\nBeauty has a number called pity. After examining something in the Woodcutter\'s Shack, increase the pity of Beauty by 1. After examining mother, increase the pity of Beauty by 2. After examining the letter, increase the pity of Beauty by 3.\n\nPoverty flashback ends when waiting or the time since poverty flashback began is five minutes.\n\nWhen Poverty flashback ends:\n\tnow family circumstances is past;\n\tsay &quot;...you finish describing the miserable circumstances of your home life, and allow your attention to return to the present.&quot;;\n\trestore the player;\n\tnow Beauty is passive;\n\tif Beauty is clever and Beauty is sympathetic\n\tbegin;\n\t\tsay &quot;\'I understand,\' she says slowly. \'Yes, I do. I\'ll do it.\' She takes a deep breath and looks at you. \'We will be king together! and your family will be royalty!\'&quot;;\n\t\tend the game in victory;\n\totherwise;\n\t\tif Beauty is sympathetic, say &quot;\'Oh dear!\' she says. \'What a dreadful life!\' She wrings her hands. \'No wonder you are eager to improve your lot...! But --\' Her brow clears, a new thought occurring. \'You needn\'t marry me, you know! We could arrange it differently! I am certain that my father would give you a large reward, instead, and then I would not be separated from my current boyfriend!\'&quot;;\n\t\totherwise say &quot;She makes a disgusted face, but she doesn\'t seem nearly so heart-wrung as you had hoped to make her. Tough audience, these modern princesses.&quot;;\n\tend if.\n\nDefinition: Beauty is sympathetic if the pity of Beauty is greater than 4.\n\nTo say attitude:\n\tif Beauty is sympathetic, say &quot;distressed on your behalf&quot;;\n\totherwise say &quot;a little confused&quot;.\n\nSaved location is a room that varies. Locker is a container. Wardrobe is a container.\n\nTo strip the player:\n\t now every thing carried by the player is in the locker;\n\tnow every thing worn by the player is in the wardrobe;\n\tchange saved location to location.\n\nTo restore the player:\n\tnow every thing carried by the player is in the location;\n\tnow every thing in the locker is carried by the player;\n\tnow every thing in the wardrobe is worn by the player;\n\tmove the player to saved location.\n\nPart 3 - The Other Secret\n\n[This time, we\'re waiting for the princess either to understand or not understand -- so we don\'t want to rerun the scene once it has happened successfully.]\n\nBeauty has a number called clue count.\n\nDramatic revelation is a scene. Dramatic revelation begins when attempting confidence.\n\nTo decide whether attempting confidence:\n\tif dramatic revelation ended in success, no;\n\tif secret identity is current, yes;\n\tno.\n\nWhen dramatic revelation begins:\n\tstrip the player;\n\tsay &quot;You reminisce about one of the many stops on the way here: you had a long journey from your homeland, and it wasn\'t made any easier by your poverty, the inability to afford decent inns or plentiful food or any kind of ride along the way.&quot;;\n\tmove the player to the Forest Clearing;\n\tmove the pack to the player; now the player wears the trousers; now the player wears the shirt.\n\nForest Clearing is a room. &quot;It\'s mid-autumn in your memory, the pool clear and cold, gold and red leaves floating on the surface.&quot;\n\nThe pool is scenery in the Clearing. Understand &quot;reflection&quot; or &quot;surface&quot; or &quot;water&quot; as the pool. &quot;The pool is cold but beautiful, and the stopping place a welcome rest.&quot; The leaves are scenery in the clearing. The description is &quot;Bright gold and orange and red: it\'s been a sharply chilly autumn, as you have reason to know in detail.&quot;\n\nThe trousers and the shirt are wearable things. The pack is a container. The pack contains ale, food, and a skirt. A distraction is a kind of thing. The ale, the food, the pair of trousers, and the shirt are distractions. The description of a distraction is usually &quot;[The item described] is not the point of this story.&quot; The shirt and the trousers are wearable. The description of the trousers is &quot;Borrowed from your oldest brother, who is only a year younger than you. They are too long for your legs and overly snug at the hip, but no one around here pays much attention to fashion, and you\'re getting away with it, more or less.&quot; After examining the trousers, increase the clue count of Beauty by 1.\n\nInstead of examining the player during dramatic revelation:\n\tincrease the clue count of Beauty by 1;\n\tsay &quot;You cannot see yourself without reflection, but you can feel your hair loose and unbound over your shoulders.&quot;\n\nRule for printing the name of the skirt while taking inventory: say &quot;one skirt you have not been able to bring yourself to part with&quot;. The description of the skirt is &quot;Made for you by your mother, and it looks quite pretty on you. If your primary plan does not work, you may be forced to wear it again, and hope to catch a male eye... but with luck that will not be necessary.&quot; After taking inventory: increase clue count of Beauty by 1.\n\nSwimming is an action applying to nothing. Understand &quot;swim&quot; or &quot;dive&quot; as swimming.\n\nInstead of swimming in the presence of the pool:\n\tincrease clue count of Beauty  by 1;\n\tsay &quot;You consider going for a swim, but don\'t dare be caught unclad and unarmed, not here. There are too many men around, and any of them discovering you here would surely take advantage.&quot;\n\nInstead of searching or drinking the pool:\n\tincrease clue count of Beauty  by 1;\n\tsay &quot;You lean over the pool and look carefully at your reflection, your hair loose and unbound, falling around your face in waves. (That should surely give it away!)&quot;\n\nInstead of waiting during dramatic revelation: say &quot;You wait for the penny to drop, for her to understand.&quot;\n\nDramatic revelation ends in failure when waiting or the time since dramatic revelation began is five minutes. When dramatic revelation ends in failure:\n\tnow secret identity is past;\n\trestore the player;\n\tnow Beauty is passive;\n\tsay &quot;She wrinkles her nose. \'I don\'t understand!\' she says. \'What are you trying to tell me?\'\n\n\tYou could weep for womankind. But you don\'t quite dare spell it out in so many words, not when someone might come up the stair and overhear a chance revelation.&quot;\n\nDramatic revelation ends in success when Beauty is clever. When dramatic revelation ends in success:\n\trestore the player;\n\tnow Beauty is passive;\n\tsay &quot;\'You\'re -- a girl? Like me?\'\n\n\'Not much like you,\' you say, glancing over her petite frame and pert nose. \'But female, at any rate.\'&quot;\n\nDefinition: Beauty is clever if the clue count of Beauty is greater than 2.\n\n[And now, since we don\'t really want to return to the rest of the \'marriage proposal\' scene once she has learned our ID:]\n\nMarriage proposal ends in distraction when Dramatic Revelation ends in success.\n\nCompromise proposal is a scene. Compromise proposal begins when Dramatic Revelation ends in success. When Compromise Proposal begins: now Beauty is passive.\n\nInstead of asking an awake beauty about a topic listed in the Table of Secondary Conversation when Compromise Proposal is happening:\n\tnow Beauty is passive;\n\tsay &quot;[reply entry][paragraph break]&quot;;\n\tblank out the whole row.\n\nEvery turn during Compromise Proposal:\n\tif Beauty is active and Beauty is visible\n\tbegin;\n\t\trepeat through Table of Secondary Conversation\n\t\tbegin;\n\t\t\tsay &quot;[quip entry][paragraph break]&quot;;\n\t\t\tif the number of filled rows in the Table of Secondary Conversation is greater than 1, blank out the whole row;\n\t\t\tmake no decision;\n\t\tend repeat;\n\tend if.\n\nEvery turn: now Beauty is active.\n\n[Notice that we moved the re-activation rule down here so that the Compromise Proposal rule would fire first. There are other more complicated ways of handling order of every turn rules than by relying on text sequence alone; but we will save that for a later chapter. For now it is sufficient to depend on the order in which the rules are declared.]\n\nTable of Secondary Conversation\ntopic\treply\tquip\n&quot;girls/me/women/female/truth/identity&quot;\t&quot;\'Marrying me would be no interference,\' you go on. \'You could carry on whatever romances you wished, without your father noticing.\' (Probably.

My beloved William will be so glad!\' You imagine that William\'s feelings on the matter will be a tad more complex than that, but do not bother quashing her exuberance...&quot;;\n\t\tend the game in victory;\n\totherwise;\n\t\tsay &quot;\'I still don\'t quite understand why you would want this so badly as to go to all that trouble,\' she admits uneasily.

<p>
<p>And now, since we don't really want to return to the rest of the 'marriage proposal' scene once she has learned our ID:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Marriage proposal ends in distraction when Dramatic Revelation ends in success.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Compromise proposal is a scene. Compromise proposal begins when Dramatic Revelation ends in success. When Compromise Proposal begins: now Beauty is passive.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of asking an awake beauty about a topic listed in the Table of Secondary Conversation when Compromise Proposal is happening:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now Beauty is passive;

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blank out the whole row.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>

</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn: now Beauty is active.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Notice that we moved the re-activation rule down here so that the Compromise Proposal rule would fire first. There are other more complicated ways of handling order of every turn rules than by relying on text sequence alone; but we will save that for a later chapter. For now it is sufficient to depend on the order in which the rules are declared.
