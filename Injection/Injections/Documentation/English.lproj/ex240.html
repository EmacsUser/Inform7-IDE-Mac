<p>What Inform calls a &quot;number&quot; is a whole number in the range
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">-32768, -32767, ..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 32767
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We are allowed to perform the same operations on numbers as are provided by a typical four-function calculator: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. We are allowed to write these either in words or in symbols:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">the score + 10
<br>100 - the score
<br>10 * 21
<br>144 / 12
<br>the score plus 10
<br>100 minus the score
<br>10 times 21
<br>10 multiplied by 21
<br>144 divided by 12
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>If we use the symbols, then spaces around them are obligatory: really, they are words which just happen to be spelt with symbols instead of letters.
<p>
<p>Division rounds down to the nearest integer (and we must never divide by 0, of course). If we try dividing 26 by 3, we will get the answer 8: but 3 does not go into 26 exactly. We can obtain the remainder, if we want to, like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">remainder after dividing 26 by 3
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>the value of which is 2, because 3 goes into 26 eight times, with remainder 2.
<p>
<p>We can compare numbers using either the traditional computer-programming symbols, or using words:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the score is less than 10
<br>if the score < 10
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>and similarly for &quot;greater than&quot;, &quot;at least&quot; and &quot;at most&quot;, with the symbols &quot;>&quot;, &quot;>=&quot; and &quot;<=&quot;. But we are not allowed the equals sign: for that we need only use &quot;is&quot; -
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the score is 10
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Finally, as we have seen, numbers up to twelve may be written out, but larger ones must be written as numerals. So &quot;twelve&quot; or &quot;12&quot;, but &quot;13&quot; only.

<p>Suppose we want to have smoke that spreads from room to room, gradually filling the entire map with a clogging smoke. Having it spread every single turn would make for a pretty rapid diffusion, so we temper this by having it spread only on even-numbered turns, instead:
