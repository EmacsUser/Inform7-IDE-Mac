<p>
<p>The model world created by Inform is partitioned into rooms. This means that everything which exists in the model world, exists in one of the rooms. If we write a sentence such as
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Professor Wilderspin is a man.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>and say nothing more about Wilderspin, then he does not physically exist at the start of the game: he is said to be &quot;out of play&quot;, and stays that way until we move him into one of the rooms. A better metaphor might be that he is waiting in the wings, ready to come onto the stage.
<p>
<p>Every thing is either out of play, or can be found in one of the rooms, and the property &quot;location of X&quot; gives us the room in question. The following condition tests, in effect, whether Wilderspin is in play:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the location of Wilderspin is a room, ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The &quot;location of the player&quot; is simply called the &quot;location&quot;, and as the player is always in play, this is always a room. If the player stands in Biblioll College and wears a waistcoat, inside which is a fob watch, then &quot;location of the fob watch&quot; is Biblioll College.
<p>
<p>In general, a thing cannot be in two rooms at once, but there are two exceptions: (two-sided) doors, present on both sides, and backdrops. The &quot;location of&quot; a door is its front side, whether it is one-sided or two-sided; but a backdrop is deemed to have no location, in the sense above. (Objects which are not things at all, such as rooms and directions, also have no location.)
<p>
<p>The idea of indirect containment is useful enough to have a name: Inform calls it &quot;enclosure&quot;. A thing encloses whatever is a part of itself, or inside itself, or on top of itself, and it also encloses anything that they enclose. And when something moves around, anything it encloses will move with it. In the example above, Biblioll College (a room) and the player (a person) both enclose the fob watch and the waistcoat. (The small print: a door is enclosed by the rooms on both sides; a backdrop is never enclosed.)
<p>
<p>Enclosure is only useful when being used as a question. So the following is fine:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the player encloses the fob watch, ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>But these will produce problem messages:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The player encloses the fob watch. The location of the trilobite is the Museum.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>because they are too vague. Inform needs to know exactly where the fob watch and the trilobite will begin the game, whereas these sentences leave room for doubt about who or what is actually holding them.

<p>Suppose we want to write a character who tries to be in the same room as the player. We will do this by testing every turn whether the character's location and the player's location are the same; if the answer is no, the character will look for a path to the player's location, then try to move along that path. (We will learn more about finding paths and giving characters instructions later.)
<p>
<p>The result will be that if the player ever moves to another location, the character will automatically pursue him.
