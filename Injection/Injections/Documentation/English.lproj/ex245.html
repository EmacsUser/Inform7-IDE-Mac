<p><b>1. When it happens.</b> &quot;Scope&quot; is a term of art in interactive fiction programming: it means the collection of things which can be interacted with at any given moment, which depends on who you are and where you are. Commands typed by the player will only be allowed to go forward into actions if the things they refer to are &quot;in scope&quot;. Inform also needs to determine scope at other times, too: for instance, when deciding whether a rule conditional on being &quot;in the presence of&quot; something is valid. It is a bad idea to say anything during this activity.
<p>
<p><b>2. The default behaviour.</b> Is complicated: see the Inform Designer's Manual, 4th edition, page 227. Briefly, the scope for someone consists of everything in the same place as them, unless it is dark.
<p>
<p><b>3. Examples.</b> (a) We very rarely want to forbid the player to refer to things close at hand, but often want to allow references to distant ones. For instance, a mirage of something which is not present at all:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After deciding the scope of the player while in the Shrine: place the holy grail in scope.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The special phrase &quot;place ... in scope&quot; does what it suggests. Ordinarily if something is placed in scope, then so are its parts and (in the case of a supporter or a transparent or open container) its contents; but we can also &quot;place the box in scope, but not its contents&quot; if we really need to place just the box itself in scope.
<p>
<p>(b) Another useful device is to be able to see, but not touch, another room:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('The Cloakroom is a room. &quot;This is just a cloakroom, but through a vague, misty mirror-window you can make out the Beyond.&quot; After looking in the Cloakroom, say &quot;In the mirror you can see [list of things in the Beyond].&quot;\n\nAfter deciding the scope of the player while in the Cloakroom: place the Beyond in scope.\n\nThe Beyond is a room. Johnny Depp is a man in the Beyond.\n\n\n')"><img border=0 src=../doc_images/paste.png></a> The Cloakroom is a room. &quot;This is just a cloakroom, but through a vague, misty mirror-window you can make out the Beyond.&quot; After looking in the Cloakroom, say &quot;In the mirror you can see [list of things in the Beyond].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After deciding the scope of the player while in the Cloakroom: place the Beyond in scope.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Beyond is a room. Johnny Depp is a man in the Beyond.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(This must, however, also be a mirage, as at time of writing Mr Depp is alive and as well as can be expected following the reviews of &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;.) When a room is placed in scope, this is understood as placing its contents in scope rather than the room-object itself. So &quot;place the Ballroom in scope&quot; allows the player to talk about the dancers, the chamber musicians and so forth, but not to &quot;EXAMINE BALLROOM&quot; as such. (This is sensible because actions like examining apply to things: and a room, unlike a container or a supporter, is not a kind of thing.)
<p>
<p>(c) In darkness, the scope of someone is ordinarily restricted to his or her possessions (and body), but we can override that:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After deciding the scope of the player while in darkness: place the location in scope.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p><b>4. A note about actions.</b> This activity takes place during the process of understanding the player's command, when the action that will take place is not fully known. So if the player types &quot;TAKE SHOEBOX&quot;, this activity would happen when SHOEBOX is being examined for meaning. Inform knows the action it would be taking if the current line of command grammar were to be accepted, but it does not yet know to what objects that command would be applied. That means attaching a proviso like &quot;... while taking a container&quot; to a rule for this activity will cause the rule to have no effect - whereas &quot;... while taking&quot; would be fine.

<p>A map of linked rooms works well for modeling enclosed or indoor space, and somewhat less well for modeling large open spaces, where a person should reasonably be able to see things which are much too far away to touch. With some modifications to scoping, though, we can create an environment where objects in nearby rooms are described and viewable, and where the player will automatically move towards distant items before interacting with them physically.

The verb to stand (it stands, they stand, it is standing) implies the height property. The verb to measure (it measures, they measure) implies the height property. A thing has a height. The height of a thing is usually 3 feet 0.\n\nDefinition: a thing is tiny if its height is 0 feet 6 inches or less.\n\nDefinition: a thing is short if its height is 3 feet 0 or less.\n\nDefinition: a thing is tall if its height is 6 feet 0 or more.\n\nThe height of a man is usually 5 feet 10 inches. The height of a woman is usually 5 feet 6 inches.\n\nDefinition: a thing is monumental if it is taller than 25 feet 0 inches.\n\nDefinition: a thing is mentionable if it stands tall enough to see.\n\nTo decide whether (item - a thing) stands tall enough to see:\n\tif the item is in the Rose Garden and the item is shorter than the roses, no;\n\tif the item is mentioned, no;\n\tif the item is in an adjacent room and item is taller than 2 feet 0, yes;\n\tif the item is taller than 4 feet 0, yes;\n\tno.\n\nInstead of examining something which is within a room (called the space) which is not the location:\n\tif the location is adjacent to the space\n\tbegin;\n\t\tif the noun is tiny, say &quot;It is too far from here for you to make out much detail about [the noun].&quot; instead;\n\t\tlet way be the best route from the location to the space;\n\t\tif the way is a direction, say &quot;You gaze off [way] at [the noun]...&quot;;\n\t\tcontinue the action;\n\totherwise;\n\t\tif the noun is short, say &quot;It is too far from here for you to make out much detail about [the noun].&quot; instead;\n\t\tlet way be the best route from the location to the space;\n\t\tif the way is a direction, say &quot;You gaze off [way] into the distance at [the noun]...&quot;;\n\t\tcontinue the action;\n\tend if.\n\n[We might also want to be able to override, manually, the way distant things are described.]\n\nWriting a distant paragraph about something is an activity.\n\nRule for writing a distant paragraph about the lily pond:\n\tif the second noun is a room and something mentionable is in the second noun, say &quot;A [lily pond], [chosen direction], patchily reflects [a list of mentionable things in the second noun] on the far side.

The description of the obelisk is &quot;It stands ridiculously tall, and has an inscription on the face.&quot;\n\nThe inscription is part of the obelisk. The height of the inscription is 0 feet 3 inches. The description of the inscription is &quot;You can\'t read the squirming, pointed letters, but they make you uneasy.&quot;.\n\nThe Gravel Circle is west of the Upper Terrace, northwest of the Middle Terrace, and north of the Croquet Ground. The description of the Gravel Circle is &quot;[if going state is 1]You head [noun] until the lawn thins and[otherwise]Here the lawn[end if] gives way to a circle of raked gravel, which crunches pleasingly beneath you.&quot;\n\nInstead of going northwest in the Upper Terrace, try going north.\n\nThe Ha-ha is north of the Gravel Circle and northwest of the Upper Terrace. The description of the Ha-ha is &quot;[if going state is 1]The land dips here so suddenly that you do not know the dip is there until you\'re in it; but it prevents livestock from crossing barriers, and that is the important thing[otherwise]You are at the base of a steep-sided depression, so the lawn continues north and south more or less at the level of your head[end if].\n\nThe tip of [the obelisk] is the only thing you can make out from this depression, off to the southeast.&quot;. North of the Ha-ha is the Sheep Field. In the Sheep Field is an animal called a black sheep. The black sheep stands 4 feet 3 inches.&quot;A black sheep grazes placidly nearby.&quot; The description of the black sheep is &quot;It reminds you of your Uncle Tim.&quot;\n\nBefore going from the Ha-ha:\n\tsay &quot;It\'s a bit of a scramble to get back up the side of the depression, and you keep slipping in the damp grass. But you manage at last.&quot;\n\nThe Rose Garden is  southwest of the Lower Terrace. The thicket of red roses is a fixed in place thing in the Rose Garden. The thicket stands 4 feet 2 inches.&quot;Heavy red roses grow over a roughly horseshoe-shaped wall around you. Over this barrier, the head of [the marble anteater] is visible to the northwest, and the tip of [the obelisk] in the distance.&quot;\n\nThe description of the Rose Garden is &quot;[if going state is 1]You slip [noun] into the enclosure of the rose garden. [end if]The rest of the park, and the world, seems muted and quiet.&quot;\n\nInstead of smelling the rose garden: try smelling the roses. Instead of smelling the roses, say &quot;The smell tickles the back of your throat and makes you want to cough.&quot;\n\nInstead of listening to the rose garden:\n\tsay &quot;You can\'t hear anything at all.&quot;\n\nThe Open Lawn is north of the Rose Garden, west of the Lower Terrace, and southwest of the Middle Terrace. The Croquet Ground is north of the Open Lawn, west of the Middle Terrace, southwest of the Upper Terrace, and northwest of the Lower Terrace.\n\nA discarded champagne cork is in the Open Lawn. It stands 0 feet 2 inches.\n\nA stone bench is an enterable supporter in the Croquet Ground. It stands 3 feet 8 inches.&quot;There is a stone bench here -- a sort of stone sofa, really, with nymphs disporting themselves on the arms and back.&quot; The description of the bench is &quot;It used to be a Roman sarcophagus -- hence the nymphs -- but someone has thoughtfully recarved it as lawn furniture.&quot;\n\nThe half-size Bentley is a vehicle in the Gravel Circle.&quot;A sort of child\'s-toy version of a Bentley is parked [if something parkable is in the location]beside [the tallest parkable thing in the location][otherwise]close at hand[end if].&quot; The description of the half-size Bentley is &quot;Of beautiful and unambiguously luxurious lines, but sized down to hold only one or (at a stretch) two people, and powered by electricity.&quot; The half-size Bentley stands 3 feet 6 inches.\n\nDefinition: a thing is parkable if it is not a person and it is not the Bentley.\n\nInstead of touching the obelisk, say &quot;Though it is black stone in sunlight, the obelisk is very cold to the touch.&quot;\n\nTest me with &quot;s / s / e / sw / ne / n / n / w / n / n / examine obelisk / touch obelisk / read inscription&quot;.\n\n\n')"><img border=0 src=../doc_images/paste.png></a> &quot;Stately Gardens&quot;

<p>
<p>The obelisk is so large that it can be seen from every room. If we had a number of such large monuments we might want to write a systematic routine to handle them, but this will do for now.

<p>
<p>Now, we set things up so that the surrounding areas are described automatically as part of the room description:
<p>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say paragraph break.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>But perhaps there are a few rooms where we do not wish that to happen, so we'll build in exceptions for those.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After looking in the rose garden:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Otherwise, you are quite cut off.&quot;.

<p>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do nothing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And suppose we want to allow the player to look in any direction:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;look [direction]&quot; or &quot;look to/toward [direction]&quot; as facing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Facing is an action applying to one visible thing.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the location is indoors, say &quot;Your view is restricted by the lack of doors or windows in that direction.&quot; instead;

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of facing up:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Above you is bright sky.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We also need to tell distant rooms how to describe themselves.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;look toward [any adjacent room]&quot; as looking toward.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Looking toward is an action applying to one visible thing.

</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And again, some exception needs to be made for seeing what's in the dip in the ground:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of looking toward the Ha-ha:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;change the chosen direction to the best route from the location to the noun;

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This is arguably an unnecessary refinement, but the listing of items in the distance gets a bit repetitive unless we vary the sentence structure.
