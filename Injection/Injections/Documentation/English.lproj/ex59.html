</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The middle column records the tasks to be achieved, the first column records the points on offer for each: the final column, initially blank, will store the times at which the tasks are first achieved.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before eating, record &quot;gluttony&quot; as achieved.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The first time we record &quot;gluttony&quot; as achieved, 2 points will be awarded and the time will be logged in the Table, but on all subsequent occasions nothing will happen. So the combination of the phrase and the Table will look after a scoring system based on achieving specific goals (probably not the seven deadly sins, of course). We can, if we choose, use the same system to display a log of recent accomplishments:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">repeat through the Table of Tasks Achieved in reverse time order begin;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[time entry]: [citation entry] ([points entry]).&quot;;
<br>end repeat.

<p>Some games provide a FULL SCORE command that gives more information about the player's achievements than SCORE alone. Supposing we wanted to include a FULL SCORE in our game that gave the kind of score reading described in this chapter:
<p>

The description of the Kitchen is &quot;Equipped with many familiar friends: refrigerator, stove, oven; countertop; cabinet for pans and bowls, and a drawer for your tools.&quot;\n\nThe stove is scenery in the kitchen. It is a supporter. The oven is a container. It is part of the stove. It is closed and openable. The stove\'s switch is a device. It is switched on. It is part of the stove. The  oven\'s dial is a device. It is switched off. It is part of the oven.\n\nA thing can be heatproof.\n\nInstead of putting something which is not heatproof on the stove when the stove\'s switch is switched on:\n\tsay &quot;You catch yourself just at the last minute: not a good idea to put [the noun] directly on the stove while it\'s turned on.&quot;\n\nInstead of switching on the stove, try switching on the stove\'s switch. Instead of switching off the stove, try switching off the stove\'s switch. Instead of switching on the oven, try switching on the oven\'s dial. Instead of switching off the oven, try switching off the oven\'s dial.\n\nBefore switching on the oven\'s dial when the oven is open:\n\tsay &quot;(closing the oven so that it will heat properly)[paragraph break]&quot;;\n\ttry closing the oven.\n\nThe frying pan is a heatproof unopenable open container on the stove.\n\nThe cabinet is a closed openable container in the kitchen. It is scenery. It contains an open unopenable container called a mixing bowl. It contains a portable supporter called a platter. An open unopenable heatproof container called a Calphalon baking dish is in the cabinet. The baking dish has the description &quot;One of those marvelous pieces of kitchen equipment which goes on the stove or in the oven, as you will. The chief thing is never ever to touch it when it is hot, since the handles are metal and the heat retention excellent.&quot;\n\nThe counter is a supporter in the kitchen. It is scenery. The kettle is a heatproof openable closed container on the counter. Some water is in the kettle.\n\nThe water can be cool, warm, or boiling. The printed name of the water is &quot;[water condition] water&quot;.\n\nThe refrigerator is a closed openable container in the kitchen. It is scenery. Understand &quot;fridge&quot; as the refrigerator.\n\nAn ingredient is a kind of thing.\n\nSome onions, some apricots, and some sage are ingredients on the counter. A chicken breast, an egg, and goat cheese are ingredients in the refrigerator.\n\nThe goat cheese can be wrapped, snipped open, or unwrapped. The printed name of the goat cheese is &quot;[goat cheese condition] goat cheese&quot;.\n\nThe sage can be unwashed, clean, or julienned. The sage is unwashed. The printed name of the sage is &quot;[sage condition] sage&quot;.\n\nThe apricots can be dried, reconstituted, or chopped. The apricots are dried. The printed name of the apricots is &quot;[apricots condition] apricots&quot;.\n\nThe chicken breast can be whole, flattened, stuffed, rolled, coated, browned, or baked. The printed name of the chicken breast is &quot;[chicken breast condition] chicken breast&quot;.\n\nThe onions can be unpeeled, peeled, diced, sauteed, or burnt. [The printed name of the onions is &quot;[onions condition] onions&quot;.]\n\nThe can of chicken broth is a closed container on the counter. The bottle of white cooking wine and the bottle of Thurston Wolfe PGV are a closed containers in the refrigerator.\n\nThe description of the Thurston Wolfe is &quot;A Washington State Pinot Gris-Viognier, 2003. It is said to have \'peach aromas\', and, startlingly, the untutored person can detect these without resorting to fantasy.\n\n(It is also supposed to possess a delicate perfume and a moderate body; the label author at least stopped short of \'good sense of humor and likes long walks on the beach\').&quot;\n\nUnderstand the commands &quot;wash&quot; and &quot;rinse&quot; as &quot;clean&quot;.\n\nInstead of rubbing the unwashed sage:\n\tnow the sage is clean;\n\tsay &quot;You rinse off the sage. There -- ready to slice.&quot;\n\nInstead of cutting the sage:\n\tsay &quot;You\'d need to have a knife in hand, first.&quot;\n\nInstead of cutting the clean sage when the player is carrying the butcher knife:\n\tnow the sage is julienned;\n\tsay &quot;You slice the sage into thin strips.&quot;\n\nInstead of cutting the unwashed sage:\n\tsay &quot;It came from the garden, so it won\'t have any strange chemicals on it, but you should still give it a rinse for dirt and bugs and so on before using it.&quot;\n\nInstead of doing something other than examining or rubbing with the unwashed sage:\n\tsay &quot;It needs to be washed off.&quot;\n\nUnderstand &quot;peel [something]&quot; as peeling.\n\nPeeling is an action applying to one thing.\n\nInstead of peeling the unpeeled onions:\n\tnow the onions are peeled;\n\tsay &quot;You tear away the shining outer skin of the onions, leaving them pale and nekkid. Poor things.&quot;\n\nInstead of cutting the diced onions:\n\tsay &quot;That seems unnecessary now.&quot;\n\nInstead of cutting the sauteed onions:\n\tsay &quot;Too late; you\'re well past that stage.&quot;\n\nInstead of cutting the burnt onions:\n\tsay &quot;There\'s no rescuing \'em -- the carbon isn\'t going to flake off, you know.&quot;\n\nInstead of cutting the unpeeled onions:\n\tsay &quot;It would help to peel them first.&quot;\n\nInstead of cutting the peeled onions:\n\tsay &quot;You\'d need to have a knife in hand, first.&quot;\n\nInstead of cutting the peeled onions when the player is carrying the butcher knife:\n\tnow the onions are diced;\n\tsay &quot;You dice the onions neatly. Your own skill brings tears to your eyes.&quot;\n\nInstead of opening the goat cheese:\n\ttry peeling the goat cheese instead.\n\nInstead of peeling the unwrapped goat cheese:\n\tsay &quot;The goat cheese is already unwrapped. (Stay focused, stay focused...)&quot;\n\nBefore peeling the wrapped goat cheese when the shears are held by the player:\n\ttry cutting the wrapped goat cheese.\n\nInstead of peeling the snipped open goat cheese:\n\tnow the goat cheese is unwrapped;\n\trecord &quot;unwrapping goat cheese&quot; as achieved;\n\tsay &quot;Ah, success. The goat cheese is now free of its packet.&quot;\n\nInstead of peeling the wrapped goat cheese:\n\tsay &quot;It would help to have a pair of scissors or something -- the packet resists being torn.&quot;\n\nInstead of cutting the goat cheese:\n\tsay &quot;No need, at this point.&quot;\n\nBefore cutting the wrapped goat cheese when the shears are not held by the player and the shears are visible:\n\tsay &quot;(first picking up the shears)[paragraph break]&quot;;\n\ttry taking the shears.\n\nInstead of cutting the wrapped goat cheese:\n\tsay &quot;Something to cut with would be useful.&quot;\n\nInstead of cutting the wrapped goat cheese when the shears are held by the player:\n\tnow the goat cheese is snipped open;\n\tsay &quot;You neatly snip through the packaging with the shears.&quot;\n\nInstead of examining the whole chicken breast:\n\tsay &quot;It is still entire and has yet to be pounded flat.&quot;\n\nInstead of examining the flattened chicken breast:\n\tsay &quot;It has been hammered to a thickness of about a half inch. (The recipe said a quarter inch but you\'re pretty sure it was joking. You have never been able to achieve a quarter inch.)&quot;\n\nInstead of attacking the whole chicken breast:\n\tsay &quot;You need something heavy enough to flatten it with.&quot;\n\nInstead of attacking the whole chicken breast when the player is holding the wooden mallet:\n\tnow the chicken breast is flattened;\n\trecord &quot;flattening chicken&quot; as achieved;\n\tsay &quot;You hammer away at the chicken breast, turning all your aggressions into culinary goodness. Several minutes pass. When you are done you have a broad flat chickeny pancake suitable for wrapping about a stuffing.&quot;\n\nBefore printing the name of onions:\n\tsay &quot;[onions condition] &quot;.\n\n\nThe drawer is an openable closed container. It is part of the counter.\n\nA tool is a kind of thing. A spatula, a spoon, a wooden mallet, some shears, and a ball of twine are tools in the drawer. A butcher knife is a tool carried by the player. Understand &quot;scissors&quot; as the shears.\n\nInstead of burning something:\n\tsay &quot;You\'ll have to do that the hard way.&quot;\n\nSome steam is fixed in place. &quot;Dense clouds of steam fill the room.&quot;\n\nSome smoke is fixed in place. &quot;Smoke is beginning to collect near the ceiling.&quot;\n\nSauteeing Onions is a scene. Sauteeing Onions begins when the diced onions are in a hot container.\n\nDefinition: a heatproof container is hot if it is on the stove and the stove\'s switch is switched on.\n\nInstead of touching the hot pan:\n\tsay &quot;Ow!&quot;\n\nScorching Onions is a scene.\n\nPreheating the Oven is a scene. Preheating the Oven begins when the oven\'s dial is heating.\n\nDefinition: a oven\'s dial is heating if the oven\'s dial has been switched on for exactly one turn.\n\nPreheating the Oven ends when the time since Preheating the Oven began is five minutes.\n\nWhen Preheating the Oven begins:\n\tsay &quot;The oven begins to warm up.&quot;\n\nWhen Preheating the Oven ends:\n\tsay &quot;The oven beeps to inform you that it has reached the desired hotness.&quot;\n\nEvery turn during Sauteeing Onions:\n\tsay &quot;The onions sizzle in the pan.&quot;\n\nEvery turn during Scorching Onions:\n\tsay &quot;The onions are past their prime and are getting blacker by the moment.&quot;\n\nEvery turn during Hearing the Kettle Whistle:\n\tsay &quot;The kettle continues to whistle.&quot;\n\nInstead of listening to during Hearing the Kettle Whistle:\n\tsay &quot;The only thing you can really hear just at the moment is the kettle.&quot;\n\nInstead of smelling the Kitchen during Sauteeing Onions:\n\ttry smelling the onions.\n\nInstead of smelling the onions during Sauteeing Onions:\n\tsay &quot;The onions smell marvelous.&quot;\n\nInstead of opening the oven during Preheating the Oven:\n\tsay &quot;It\'ll never heat if you open it up while it\'s warming.&quot;\n\nHeating Kettle is a scene. Heating Kettle begins when the hot kettle contains cool water.\n\nBefore printing the name of the kettle when the kettle is hot:\n\tsay &quot;hot &quot;\n\nWhen Heating Kettle begins:\n\tsay &quot;The kettle begins to heat up.&quot;\n\nHeating Kettle ends when the time since Heating Kettle began is 7 minutes.\n\nHearing the Kettle Whistle is a scene. Hearing the Kettle Whistle begins when Heating Kettle ends. Hearing the Kettle Whistle ends when the kettle is not hot.\n\nWhen Hearing the Kettle Whistle begins:\n\tnow the water is boiling;\n\tsay &quot;The kettle begins to burble and whistle shrilly.&quot;\n\nWhen Hearing the Kettle Whistle ends:\n\tsay &quot;The kettle\'s screaming dies off.&quot;\n\nIdling is a scene. Idling begins when play begins. Idling ends when Sauteeing Onions begins.\n\nSauteeing Onions ends in disaster when Scorching Onions begins.\n\nSauteeing Onions ends in success when the onions are sauteed and onions are not in a hot container.\n\nDefinition: a thing is alone if it is in a container which contains exactly one thing.\n\nSauteeing Onions ends in mixture when the sauteed onions are not alone.\n\nWhen Sauteeing Onions ends in mixture:\n\tsay &quot;The mixture of things in [the holder of the onions] stops them cooking quite so fast.&quot;\n\nWhen Sauteeing Onions ends in success:\n\tsay &quot;Nice work with the onions.&quot;\n\nEvery turn:\n\tif diced onions have been in a hot pan for ten turns\n\tbegin;\n\t\tsay &quot;The onions are starting to look ready.&quot;;\n\t\tnow the onions are sauteed;\n\tend if.\n\nScorching Onions begins when Sauteeing Onions ends in disaster. Scorching Onions begins when the alone sauteed onions are in a hot container.\n\nScorching Onions ends horribly when the time since Scorching Onions began is three minutes. Scorching Onions ends in reprieve when the sauteed onions are not in a hot container.  Scorching Onions ends in mixture when the sauteed onions are not alone.\n\nWhen Scorching Onions ends in mixture:\n\trecord &quot;sauteeing onions&quot; as achieved;\n\tsay &quot;The mixture of things in [the holder of the onions] stops them cooking quite so fast.&quot;\n\nWhen Scorching Onions ends horribly:\n\tmove smoke to Kitchen;\n\tnow the onions are burnt.\n\nWhen Scorching Onions ends in reprieve:\n\trecord &quot;sauteeing onions&quot; as achieved;\n\tsay &quot;You\'ve got the onions off heat before they can scorch -- a good sign.&quot;\n\nInstead of taking the onions when the onions are in the pan: try taking the pan.\n\nInstead of smelling in the presence of the smoke:\n\tsay &quot;The scent of the late disaster lingers in the air.&quot;\n\nReconstituting the Apricots is a scene.\n\nReconstituting the Apricots begins when the dried apricots are in a container which contains boiling water.\n\nWhen Reconstituting the Apricots begins:\n\tsay &quot;The apricots slowly begin to plump up again.&quot;\n\nReconstituting the Apricots ends when the dried apricots are not in a container which contains boiling water.\n\nEvery turn:\n\tif dried apricots have been in a container which contains boiling water for ten turns\n\tbegin;\n\t\tsay &quot;The apricots have turned plump(ish).&quot;;\n\t\tnow the apricots are reconstituted;\n\t\trecord &quot;reconstituting apricots&quot; as achieved;\n\tend if.\n\nTest sautee with &quot;peel onions / cut onions / get onions / put onions in pan / get sage / wash sage / cut sage / wait / wait / wait / wait / wait / wait / wait / get pan&quot;.\n\nTest apricots with &quot;get kettle / open kettle / get apricots / put apricots in kettle / put kettle on stove / wait / wait / wait / wait / wait / wait / wait / wait / wait / wait / wait / wait / wait / wait / wait / wait / wait&quot;.\n\nTest chicken with &quot;open refrigerator / get chicken / open drawer / get mallet / hit breast&quot;.\n\nTest cheese with &quot;get scissors / get cheese / unwrap cheese&quot;.\n\nTest me with &quot;full score / test sautee / full score / test apricots / full score / test chicken / full score / test cheese / full score&quot;.\n\n\n')"><img border=0 src=../../doc_images/paste.png></a> &quot;Goat-Cheese and Sage Chicken&quot;

<p>And... at that point you're a lot less close to being done than you think. The filling -- onions, sage, apricot, and cheese -- must be assembled and put in the chicken breasts; these tied up in string; each roll dipped in egg yolk and rolled in panko crumbs; these arranged in the Calphalon pan and baked. Then later, the whole retrieved from the oven, and the breasts transferred to a plate while we deglaze the pan and concoct the sauce with the chicken broth, wine, butter, etc. Then the chicken is sliced and plated, and the sauce poured over top. Usually one also wants a side dish or two.
