New activities</b></font></td></tr></table>
<p>
<p>Activities are all about influencing the standard mechanisms which Inform uses, so it might at first seem that there is no need to create new activities: but on further reflection, quite a lot of the writing of interactive fiction involves creating new and systematic ways to do things, and as soon as we have a general rule, we will want to have exceptions. Inform therefore allows us to create our own activities, giving us ways to influence the operation of our own mechanisms.
<p>
<p>There are two kinds of activity: those which relate to a specific thing or room, and those which do not. The following creates one of each kind:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Analysing something is an activity.
<br>Assaying is an activity.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Here &quot;analysing something&quot; relates to a specific item: Inform knows this because it looks for the clue &quot;something&quot; (or &quot;of something&quot;) after the activity's name, which in the first case above is simply &quot;analysing&quot;.
<p>
<p>Creating an activity is like creating an action: it automatically makes new rulebooks - &quot;before analysing&quot;, &quot;for analysing&quot; and &quot;after analysing&quot; - but they start out empty, so the activity does nothing yet. Moreover, it never happens. We can make an activity happen at any time by writing phrases like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">carry out the analysing activity with the pitchblende;
<br>carry out the assaying activity;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>To make the activity do something useful, we need to put a rule into its &quot;for&quot; rulebook:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The last for assaying rule:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Professionally, you cast an eye around mineral deposits nearby, noticing [list of rocks in the location].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>&quot;The last&quot; is a technicality about rulebooks (see the next chapter) which, put briefly, guarantees that this rule comes last among all possible &quot;for assaying&quot; rules. This is good form because the whole point of an activity is to make it easy for further rules to interfere - so we deliberately hang back to last place, giving precedence to anybody else who wants it.
<p>
<p>It may look rather pretentious to dress up the footling little &quot;assaying&quot; example as an activity, but it gains us more than might first appear. Every new activity created provides a context which other activities can observe. We could, for instance, define
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for printing the name of a rock while assaying: ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>so that during assays more technical names are used.

<p>
<p>Suppose we want to add rules so that any time we examine a charred object (and most of our objects can be charred), a line about the charring is appended to the end of the object description. We could use &quot;after examining...&quot;, but perhaps we would prefer for the sentence about the charring not to appear in its own paragraph.
<p>
<p>This is an ideal occasion for a new activity. We look at the action index for &quot;examining&quot; to identify the rule that causes the old behavior (in this case, the &quot;standard examining rule&quot;); replace this with a new rule that calls our activity; and write our &quot;printing the description&quot; activity in such a way that it uses an object's description without forcing a paragraph return afterward.
<p>
<p>Then we will use &quot;after printing the description&quot; to add our line about charring, and make sure that the paragraph return does occur before the prompt.
<p>
<p>So:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('&quot;Crusoe&quot;\n\nThe Desert Isle is a room. &quot;A pale expanse of sand, here and there developing into hillocks of grass, and a small clump of palms.

<p>
<p>This instruction replaces a normal piece of the examine action, the standard examining rule, with another one of our own devising. (The procedural rule will be explained in more detail in the chapter on rulebooks.)
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Printing the description of something is an activity.

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">This is the fancy examining rule:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;carry out the printing the description activity with the noun.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>All we have done here is enclose what is usually just a rule inside an activity. This means that we can now write before and after rules for the activity, and also add special instructions like &quot;Rule for printing the name of something while printing the description of something&quot; -- this may not be likely to arise often, but Inform now has the concept of &quot;printing the description of something&quot; as a separate context of action. Next we add the modification that lets us append to the description without a new line:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for printing the description of something (called item):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[description of item] [run paragraph on]&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>&quot;run paragraph on&quot; here will mean that we do not get a paragraph break following the description, even if it ends with a period. We also insert a space, so that our follow-on comments will be properly punctuated.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After printing the description of something charred:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;It is charred.&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The instead at the end of this line stops Inform for going on with any other &quot;after printing the description of...&quot; rules.
<p>
<p>And now, because we want to make sure that we always do get a paragraph break after our description, we add this rule last after all the other rules. &quot;Last&quot; and &quot;first&quot; rules are covered in more detail in the chapter on rulebooks.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Last after printing the description of something:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say paragraph break.

<p>The player's description is handled in an unusual way, and this will produce a space paragraph break there where it should not. Instead, therefore, we will add an instead for examining the player (probably a good idea anyway):
