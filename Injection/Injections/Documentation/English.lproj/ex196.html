<p>
<p>A variety of &quot;conditions&quot; have already appeared in this documentation. A condition is a phrase which describes a situation which might be true, or might be false, and examples might include:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Mr Kite is in Bishopsgate
<br>the score is greater than 10
<br>Sherlock Holmes suspects a woman
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>These are all examples of sentences, formed by putting nouns either side of a verb, and clearly a wide range of conditions can be written this way. But there are also a few special conditions built into Inform which have a fixed wording, and test questions difficult to address with ordinary sentences. For instance, the condition
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">in darkness
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(e.g., &quot;if in darkness...&quot;) tests whether the player is currently in the dark, and this is better than the more obvious-looking
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">the player is in a dark room
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>since the player might have a torch, or be inside a cage which is itself in a dark room, and so on. Another example of a condition not easily written as a sentence is
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">player consents
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(e.g., &quot;if the player consents...&quot;) which is unusual in doing something and not simply making a silent check: it waits for the player to type YES (or Y) or NO (or N) at the keyboard.

<p>
<p>Suppose we want to ask the player a question where he might say yes or no in response. There are two possible forms of this: the modal question where the player must pick one to proceed, and the non-modal question where he might also type other verbs.

<p>

</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of answering Mr Spruce that &quot;yes&quot;, try saying yes.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of asking Mr Spruce to try saying yes, try saying yes.
