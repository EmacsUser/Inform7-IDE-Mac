<p>When testing conditions, we normally talk only about specific things, or else ask if a particular circumstance happens:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the oaken door is open
<br>if a woman is carrying an animal
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>But we can also use &quot;all&quot;, &quot;each&quot; or &quot;every&quot; to check the whole range:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if each door is open
<br>if anyone is carrying all of the animals
<br>if everybody is in the Dining Room
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Inform allows other English &quot;determiners&quot; (as they are sometimes called), as well:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if some of the doors are open
<br>if most of the doors are open
<br>if almost all of the doors are open
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>are true if at least one case is true, if a majority (any number greater than one half) or at least 80 per cent of the possible cases are true, respectively.
<p>
<p>And we can also use &quot;none&quot; and &quot;no&quot;. These three are all ways to say the same thing:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if no door is open
<br>if all of the doors are not open
<br>if none of the doors is open
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>though it may be clearer style to find a positive way of putting things:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if all of the doors are closed
</font></blockquote><p>

<p>This example does include a number of features that we haven't met yet, particularly rulebooks. Nonetheless, the basic idea should be relatively clear. Our premise is that the player is faced with a series of disgruntled furnishings, none of which want to be responsible for supporting the cold, hot, drippy, or spiky objects lying around the room.

The original set of chairs has been taken away, leaving only a red velvet dining chair and a blue suede armchair.&quot;\n\nThe fussy table is a supporter in the Dining Room. It is scenery. The description is &quot;It\'s hypochondriac: the result of a sojourn in a superior antique shop, where it picked up the scent of almond oil, words like provenance, and a secretive shame about being resurfaced.\n\nChairs don\'t get along with it.\n\nIn its mellowest moods, after a really good dusting, it will mention, casually, a cabinet it once knew, which was twelve feet tall, came from the Winter Palace, and had an asking price of $350K.&quot;\n\nA chair is a kind of supporter with carrying capacity 1. A chair is enterable. A chair is usually scenery. Understand &quot;chair&quot; as a chair.\n\nThe blue suede armchair and the red velvet dining chair are chairs in the Dining Room. The description of the blue suede is &quot;Quiet, mellow, and with a lingering aroma of clove cigarettes, and possibly something less legal. It doesn\'t sit up straight, and doesn\'t let anyone else do so either.&quot; The red velvet has the description &quot;In temperament, in bearing, in everything it is the opposite of the blue suede chair. It is concerned for its duty all the time, has a rigidly straight back, and pokes diners in the spine when it suspects them of overdoing things.&quot;\n\nThe carrying capacity of the player is 2.\n\nSection 2 - Sources of Unpleasantness\n\nA thing can be drippy or dry.\n\nHeat is a kind of value.

We can use the counting of contented supporters to decide when the player is getting close to winning and it\'s time for her to bring something else...]\n\nSection 5 - Source of Further Complications\n\nThe Tidy Kitchen is south of the Dining Room. Alison is a woman in the Tidy Kitchen. The kettle is a scalding thing. The ceramic tile is a cold portable supporter. It has carrying capacity 1. The platter is a scalding portable supporter.

Whistling chirpily, Alison brings it in and sets it down smack on [the next victim], then goes back out.&quot;;\n\t\trule succeeds;\n\tend if.\n\n[And just so that the player knows where he stands at the end of each turn:]\n\nSection 6 - General Assessment\n\nAn every turn rule:\n\tif some of the things are concerned, say &quot;You sense some resentment from [the list of concerned things].&quot;;\n\nAn every turn rule:\n\tif the player is carrying more than one scalding thing\n\tbegin;\n\t\tlet the dropped item be a random scalding thing carried by the player;\n\t\tsay &quot;You can\'t hang onto so many burning hot things, and lose your grip on [the dropped item].[line break]&quot;;\n\t\tsilently try dropping the dropped item;\n\tend if.\n\nAn every turn rule:\n\tif almost all of the supporters are concerned,\n\t\tsay &quot;\'I hope everything is going well,\' bellows Alison from the other room.&quot;\n\n[Finally, we need some rules to decide when the player is, in fact, finished.]\n\nSection 7 - Scoring\n\nAn every turn rule:\n\tchange score to 5 minus the number of concerned things;\n\tif the location is concerned, change score to score minus 1;\n\tif all of the supporters are concerned and the location is concerned, end the game in death;\n\tif none of the supporters are concerned and the location is not concerned, end the game in victory.\n\nThe maximum score is 5.\n\nWhen play begins, change score to 4.\n\nTest me with &quot;i / take off left shoe / get the glass / put the glass on the platter / get the tile / drop the tile / get the kettle / put the kettle on tile / sit on the blue armchair&quot;.\n\n')"><img border=0 src=../doc_images/paste.png></a> &quot;Revenge of the Fussy Table&quot;
