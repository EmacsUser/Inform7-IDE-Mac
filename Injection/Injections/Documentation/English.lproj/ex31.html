<p>Creating a new rulebook is also straightforward, as we see in the following modest example game:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('&quot;Appraisal&quot;\n\nThe Passage is east of the Tomb. The green-eyed idol is in the Tomb. A Speak-Your-Progress machine is in the Passage.\n\nAppraisal rules is a rulebook.\n\nAn appraisal rule: say &quot;Click... whirr... the score is [the score in words] points.&quot;\n\nAn appraisal rule: if we have taken the idol then say &quot;Most importantly of all, the idol has been found.&quot;\n\nInstead of switching on the machine, follow the appraisal rules.\n\n\n')"><img border=0 src=../doc_images/paste.png></a> &quot;Appraisal&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Passage is east of the Tomb. The green-eyed idol is in the Tomb. A Speak-Your-Progress machine is in the Passage.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Appraisal rules is a rulebook.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">An appraisal rule: say &quot;Click... whirr... the score is [the score in words] points.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">An appraisal rule: if we have taken the idol then say &quot;Most importantly of all, the idol has been found.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of switching on the machine, follow the appraisal rules.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The creation of the rulebook is all very well, but without the final sentence it would never be used. The crucial new phrase here is &quot;follow ...&quot;, which is the first of several phrases allowing us to use rules whenever we want to (rather than simply at predetermined times such as when a particular action is being tried, or at the end of every turn, and such).
<p>
<p>Like &quot;number&quot; or &quot;text&quot;, &quot;rule&quot; and &quot;rulebook&quot; are kinds of value built into Inform: &quot;the blossom rule&quot; is a value whose kind is &quot;rule&quot;, whereas &quot;the every turn rules&quot; is a value whose kind is &quot;rulebook&quot;. In fact, Inform considers a rulebook to be a special case of a rule, so that whenever a rule is required it is legal to name a rulebook instead, but not vice versa. The &quot;follow&quot; phrase here...
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of switching on the machine, follow the appraisal rules.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>...expects to be applied to a value of kind &quot;rule&quot;; &quot;the appraisal rules&quot; is in fact a rulebook, but since that counts as a rule the phrase makes sense to Inform. To follow a rulebook means to run through all its rules in turn, stopping when one rule reaches an outcome; to follow a single rule means just that one, of course.

All of that was general and could be used in any setting, but we now provide a small game to show it off.]\n\nPart II - Escape from the Library of the Dead\n\nThe Library of the Dead is a room. &quot;This room -- little, dank, stone -- is filling with some miasma you do not quite dare breathe.

It is openable, lockable, and locked. The desk is scenery.\n\nA box is in the Library. A metal hinge is part of the box. The hinge is flame-retardant. The box is open, flammable, and openable. The shroud of Laertes is a flammable thing in the box.\n\nInstead of examining something when something is part of the noun:\n\tsay &quot;You note [the list of things which are part of the noun].&quot;\n\nThe world\'s last manuscript of the Psychagogoi by Aeschylus is on the desk.

The asbestos sack is a flame-retardant player\'s holdall in the drawer.\n\nThe trapdoor is up of the Library and east of the Plaza. The trapdoor is a door. It is flammable, closed, lockable, and locked. &quot;A trapdoor in the ceiling is your only hope of escape[if flaming]. Fortunately, it is rapidly burning through[end if].&quot; The trapdoor has endurance 15.\n\nInstead of going through the closed trapdoor, say &quot;[The trapdoor] is closed.&quot;\n\n[We can then add a special fire rule to handle the trapdoor, which will be called as part of the same sequence. Again, this would be most important if the fire rules were part of a standard extension, and the trapdoor fire rule the author\'s own addition.]\n\nA fire rule:\n\tif the trapdoor is flaming and a random chance of 1 in 3 succeeds\n\tbegin;\n\t\tlet the caught thing be a random flammable whole thing which can be touched by the trapdoor;\n\t\tif the caught thing is a thing\n\t\tbegin;\n\t\t\tsay &quot;A spark from [the trapdoor] catches [the caught thing]!&quot;;\n\t\t\tnow the caught thing is flaming;\n\t\tend if;\n\tend if.\n\nInstead of going to the Plaza:\n\tsay &quot;Out at last!&quot;;\n\tend the game in victory.\n\nTest me with &quot;get manuscript / get shroud / light desk / look / g / open drawer / look / g / g / g / get sack / put shroud in sack / put manuscript in sack / close sack / light trapdoor / look / g / g / g / g / g / g / g / g / g / g / g / g / g / g / up&quot;.\n\n')"><img border=0 src=../doc_images/paste.png></a> &quot;In Fire or in Flood&quot;

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before printing the name of a damp door:

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of taking something when the noun is in a flaming thing (called the receptacle):

<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of touching something which is within a flaming thing (called the receptacle):

<p>
<p>And that completes the rules which cover burning: things can catch fire, fire will spread, and gradually consume the world in flames. All of that was general and could be used in any setting, but we now provide a small game to show it off.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Part II - Escape from the Library of the Dead
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Library of the Dead is a room. &quot;This room -- little, dank, stone -- is filling with some miasma you do not quite dare breathe. It is imperative that you get out.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The desk is a flammable supporter in the Library. A drawer is part of the desk. The drawer is a flammable closed container. It is openable, lockable, and locked. The desk is scenery.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A box is in the Library. A metal hinge is part of the box. The hinge is flame-retardant. The box is open, flammable, and openable. The shroud of Laertes is a flammable thing in the box.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of examining something when something is part of the noun:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You note [the list of things which are part of the noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The world's last manuscript of the Psychagogoi by Aeschylus is on the desk. The manuscript is flammable. The manuscript has endurance 1.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The torch is a flammable flaming thing carried by the player. It has endurance 60. The asbestos sack is a flame-retardant player's holdall in the drawer.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The trapdoor is up of the Library and east of the Plaza. The trapdoor is a door. It is flammable, closed, lockable, and locked. &quot;A trapdoor in the ceiling is your only hope of escape[if flaming]. Fortunately, it is rapidly burning through[end if].&quot; The trapdoor has endurance 15.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of going through the closed trapdoor, say &quot;[The trapdoor] is closed.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We can then add a special fire rule to handle the trapdoor, which will be called as part of the same sequence. Again, this would be most important if the fire rules were part of a standard extension, and the trapdoor fire rule the author's own addition.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A fire rule:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the trapdoor is flaming and a random chance of 1 in 3 succeeds
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let the caught thing be a random flammable whole thing which can be touched by the trapdoor;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the caught thing is a thing
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;A spark from [the trapdoor] catches [the caught thing]!&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the caught thing is flaming;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if.

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of going to the Plaza:

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end the game in victory.
