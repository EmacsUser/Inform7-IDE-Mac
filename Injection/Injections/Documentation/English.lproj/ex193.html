<p>
<p>We are allowed to link the beginning or end of any scene to the beginning or end of any other scene. So, for instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Luggage Trouble is a scene. Luggage Trouble begins when Brief Encounter begins.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Thus the two scenes run concurrently, at least for a while. We can also add that:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Luggage Trouble ends when Brief Encounter ends.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This can be useful when a large, complicated scene really contains several smaller sub-scenes.
<p>
<p>A special exceptional case is that we can have any scene or scenes starting right at the outset:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Railway Meeting is a scene. Railway Meeting begins when play begins.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>When play ends, of course, all scenes end, so there is no need to say that.

<p>Suppose we want to remind the player that he doesn't have all the time in the world, by starting to nag him when he's nearly, but not entirely, done going over his inventory in preparation for a job.
