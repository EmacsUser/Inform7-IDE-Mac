<p>Inform allows us to perform arithmetic on units only where that would make sense, and it keeps track of the results. For instance,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('The Weighbridge is a room. &quot;A sign declares that the maximum load is [100kg multiplied by 3].&quot;\n\n\n')"><img border=0 src=../../doc_images/paste.png></a> The Weighbridge is a room. &quot;A sign declares that the maximum load is [100kg multiplied by 3].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>...will produce the text &quot;A sign declares that the maximum load is 300kg.&quot; Here Inform knows that it makes sense to multiply a weight by 3, and that the result will be a weight. Similarly, Inform allows us to add and subtract weights, and several different forms of division are allowed:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('The blackboard is in the Weighbridge. &quot;A blackboard propped against one wall reads: \'122 / 10 is [122 divided by 10] remainder [remainder after dividing 122 by 10]; but 122kg / 10kg is [122kg divided by 10kg] remainder [remainder after dividing 122kg by 10kg]; and 122kg / 10 is [122kg divided by 10] remainder [remainder after dividing 122kg by 10].\'&quot;\n\n\n')"><img border=0 src=../../doc_images/paste.png></a> The blackboard is in the Weighbridge. &quot;A blackboard propped against one wall reads: '122 / 10 is [122 divided by 10] remainder [remainder after dividing 122 by 10]; but 122kg / 10kg is [122kg divided by 10kg] remainder [remainder after dividing 122kg by 10kg]; and 122kg / 10 is [122kg divided by 10] remainder [remainder after dividing 122kg by 10].'&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>When we visit the Weighbridge, we find:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A blackboard propped against one wall reads: &quot;122 / 10 is 12 remainder 2; but 122kg / 10kg is 12 remainder 2kg; and 122kg / 10 is 12kg remainder 2kg.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Whereas we are not allowed to divide 122 by 10kg: that would make no sense, since 122 is a number and not made up of kilograms. Inform will produce a problem message if we try.

<p>In our brave new world, everything will have a price, so we had better spell this out.
