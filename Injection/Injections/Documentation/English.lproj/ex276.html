Change of properties with values</b></font></td></tr></table>
<p>
<p>Changing properties with values is very similar:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">change the printed name of the Closet to &quot;Suddenly Spooky Closet&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Inform checks three different things to ensure that this change is safe to perform. Firstly, the value must be the right kind for the property in question, so this for instance would be rejected:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">change the printed name of the Closet to 7
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Secondly, the object in question has to be allowed to have the given property. This, for instance, would be disallowed:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">change the initial appearance of the Closet to &quot;Dusty&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(since &quot;initial appearance&quot; is a property which only things can have, not rooms). Finally, the object has to actually have the property, not just have the right to have that property. Thus:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">change the printed name of the Closet to &quot;Suddenly Spooky Closet&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>...is only permitted if the Closet is designed with a &quot;printed name&quot;. In fact this is certain to be true: all rooms and things automatically have a printed name, which is the short boldface description in the case of rooms, and the usual text briefly describing something in the case of things.
