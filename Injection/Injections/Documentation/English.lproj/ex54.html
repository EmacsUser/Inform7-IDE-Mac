<p>
<p>In the photography example, we are providing entirely new grammar for an action  not ordinarily built in to Inform. But we often want simply to provide alternative grammar for existing actions, or even to put new interpretations on commands that Inform already recognises. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;deposit [something] in [an open container]&quot; as inserting it into.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The inserting action is built in to Inform, but the command &quot;deposit&quot; is not, so this is created as new. It is occasionally useful to put a twist on this:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;fill [an open container] with [something]&quot; as inserting it into (with nouns reversed).
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The clause &quot;(with nouns reversed)&quot; tells Inform to exchange the two nouns parsed, which is necessary because the inserting action expects the noun to be the item and the second noun to be the container, not vice versa.
<p>
<p>The following example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;access [something]&quot; as opening.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>might look as if it makes &quot;access&quot; behave just like &quot;open&quot; when the player types it, but that's not so: &quot;open&quot; can also be used in constructions like &quot;open the door with the brass key&quot;, in which case it is understood as the unlocking action. We could add another line to make &quot;access&quot; behave this way too, but if what we really want is to make &quot;access&quot; behave just like &quot;open&quot;, it's easier simply to say so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand the command &quot;access&quot; as &quot;open&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This is very useful when adding a new command which needs synonyms:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand the commands &quot;snap&quot; and &quot;picture&quot; as &quot;photograph&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We can check the current stock of commands by looking at the table in the Actions index: for instance, before making &quot;snap&quot; synonymous with &quot;photograph&quot;, it might be wise to check that it is not already defined as a command for breaking something.

<p>
<p>&quot;Cloak of Darkness&quot; is a brief example game that has been implemented in nearly every IF system currently used. It hasn't got much claim to complexity or richness, but it does exemplify many of the standard things one might want an IF language to be able to do: define descriptions and the results of actions, assign synonyms to nouns, create new verbs, handle darkness, track repeated acts, and so on.
<p>
<p>Here is what the game looks like in Inform:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('&quot;Cloak of Darkness&quot;\n\nThe story headline is &quot;A basic IF demonstration.&quot;\n\nThe maximum score is 2.\n\n[Whatever room we define first becomes the starting room of the game, in the absence of other instructions:]\n\nFoyer of the Opera House is a room.  &quot;You are standing in a spacious hall, splendidly decorated in red and gold, with glittering chandeliers overhead.

Unless we say otherwise, the connection will automatically be bidirectional, so &quot;The Cloakroom is west of the Foyer&quot; will also mean &quot;The Foyer is east of the Cloakroom&quot;:]\n\nThe Cloakroom is west of the Foyer. &quot;The walls of this small room were clearly once lined with hooks, though now only one remains. The exit is a door to the east.&quot;\n\nIn the Cloakroom is a supporter called the small brass hook. The hook is scenery. Understand &quot;peg&quot; as the hook.\n\n[Inform will automatically understand any words in the object definition (&quot;small&quot;, &quot;brass&quot;, and &quot;hook&quot;, in this case), but we can add extra synonyms with this sort of Understand command.]\n\nThe description of the hook is &quot;It\'s just a small brass hook, [if something is on the hook]with [a list of things on the hook] hanging on it[otherwise]screwed to the wall[end if].&quot;\n\n[This description is general enough that, if we were to add other hangable items to the game, they would automatically be described correctly as well.]\n\nThe Bar is south of the Foyer.

<p>We can add more rooms by specifying their relation to the first room. Unless we say otherwise, the connection will automatically be bidirectional, so &quot;The Cloakroom is west of the Foyer&quot; will also mean &quot;The Foyer is east of the Cloakroom&quot;:

<p>
<p>Inform will automatically understand any words in the object definition (&quot;small&quot;, &quot;brass&quot;, and &quot;hook&quot;, in this case), but we can add extra synonyms with this sort of Understand command.

<p>
<p>This second rule takes precedence over the first one whenever the message is trampled. Inform automatically applies whichever rule is most specific:
