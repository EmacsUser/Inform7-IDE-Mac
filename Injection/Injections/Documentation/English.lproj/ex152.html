<p>
<p>To recap, actions are created like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Photographing is an action applying to one visible thing and requiring light.
<br>Depositing it in is an action applying to two things.
<br>Taking inventory is an action applying to nothing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Actions can involve up to two different things. We can place additional requirements on any of these things by describing them as a &quot;visible thing&quot;, &quot;touchable thing&quot; or &quot;carried thing&quot;. (If we simply say &quot;thing&quot; or &quot;things&quot;, as in the second example, Inform assumes the requirement to be &quot;touchable&quot;.) These three conditions are increasingly strong:
<p>
<p>- To be &quot;visible&quot;, something needs only to be possible to refer to by the player, which in practice means that it must be visible to the player-character. The noun or second noun produced by any action resulting from a command at the keyboard will always satisfy this minimal condition.
<p>
<p>- To be &quot;touchable&quot;, the player-character must be able to physically touch the thing in question: this normally means that it must be in the same room, and there must be no physical barriers in between.
<p>
<p>- To be &quot;carried&quot;, the player-character must (directly) carry the thing in question. (But if the player types a command using an action requiring something &quot;carried&quot;, like WEAR HAT, the thing in question - the hat - will sometimes be picked up automatically. This is called &quot;implicit taking&quot;, and results in text like &quot;(first taking the top hat)&quot; being printed.)
<p>
<p>If an action involves two things, they need not have the same requirement as each other:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Waving it at is an action applying to one carried thing and one visible thing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Thus to &quot;wave magic wand at banyan tree&quot;, the player must be holding the wand, but need only be able to see the tree.
<p>
<p>Note one special case. Requirements on touchability are waived in the case of &quot;try&quot; actions applied to people other than the player where the things they would need to touch are doors or backdrops. (This is a compromise to avoid difficulties arising from the ambiguous locations of such items.)

<p>
<p>Using the compass directions in commands is a little bit finicky because directions are forbidden to figure in any interactions involving touch. (Really, directions are more a concept than an object; this is a compromise situation.) In any case, if we want to write a new command involving these, we need to be sure to specify that the direction is a visible thing. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Eddystone&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Lighthouse is a room. &quot;A lonely place, but in these tense times, no one but the lighthouse keeper and a few trusted agents are allowed on the grounds at all, for fear of sabotage.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The light is a fixed in place thing in the Lighthouse.  &quot;At the center of the room is the light itself, a 1000-Watt tungsten halogen light powered by diesel generator, and having a visible range of twenty-six nautical miles.&quot; Understand &quot;lamp&quot; as the light. It is lit. The light has a a direction called heading. The heading of the light is north.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A room is usually dark.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;turn [something] [a direction]&quot; as reorienting it to. Reorienting it to is an action applying to two things.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>will give us
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">>turn light northeast
<br>You must name something more substantial.

<p>
<p>To avoid this mystifying result:
<p>
