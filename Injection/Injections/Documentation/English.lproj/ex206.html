<p>Similarly, it is forbidden to multiply 122kg and 10kg, not because it could never make sense (a physicist will occasionally multiply two weights) but because the result is - what? Not a number, and not a weight any more. But we are allowed to tell Inform what the result ought to be, and once we have done so, the multiplication will be allowed:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('A length is a kind of value. 10m specifies a length. An area is a kind of value. 10 sq m specifies an area.\n\nA length times a length specifies an area.\n\nThe balance platform is in the Weighbridge. &quot;The balance platform is 10m by 8m, giving it an area of [10m multiplied by 8m].&quot;\n\n\n')"><img border=0 src=../../doc_images/paste.png></a> A length is a kind of value. 10m specifies a length. An area is a kind of value. 10 sq m specifies an area.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A length times a length specifies an area.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The balance platform is in the Weighbridge. &quot;The balance platform is 10m by 8m, giving it an area of [10m multiplied by 8m].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>which will turn up as:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The balance platform is 10m by 8m, giving it an area of 80 sq m.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And having told Inform that lengths multiply to area, we could also divide an area by a length to get a length: no further instructions would be needed.
<p>
<p>Note that we are only allowed to make such a rule about multiplication, and only between units, and the result has to be a unit. So this system cannot be used to make Inform multiply, say, a time by a piece of text, nor to contradict any of the standard &quot;dimensional rules&quot; outlined above.

<p>
<p>Several warnings about this. One is that the numbers can't go very high: while the volume can in theory go to 32,767, in practice this equates to an object 32 cm on a side, which is not very large. It will therefore be a good idea to choose dimensions that fit the needs of the game: in some circumstances a decimeter might be a better basic unit of measurement, for instance.
<p>
<p>The other is that the system will require a height, width, and depth for every portable object in the game, which is a large commitment of data entry; it may be kind of tiresome. So it is probably not worth bothering with this kind of simulation unless it is going to be genuinely significant.
