<p>
<p>Welcome to Inform, a design system for interactive fiction based on natural language.
<p>
<p>Interactive fiction is a literary form which involves programming a computer so that it presents a reader with a text which can be explored. Inform aims to make the burden of learning to program such texts as light as possible. It is a tool for writers intrigued by computing, and computer programmers intrigued by writing. Perhaps these are not so very different pursuits, in their rewards and pleasures:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The sheer joy of making things... the fascination of fashioning complex puzzle-like objects of interlocking moving parts and watching them work in subtle cycles... the delight of working in such a tractable medium. The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination. (Frederick P. Brooks, &quot;The Mythical Man-Month&quot;, 1972)
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>These notes aim to be concise. They are arranged so that the reader can, in principle, write whole works of fiction as early as the end of Chapter 3. Each subsequent chapter then extends the range of techniques available to make livelier and more intriguing situations.
<p>
<p>For the benefit of partially sighted users, duplicate versions of this book in plain text and lightly-formatted HTML formats can be found at the Inform website.
<p>
<p>This new release of Inform (&quot;Inform 7&quot;, the seventh major version since 1993) is a radical departure from most previous approaches to interactive fiction. In particular, it is very different from Inform 6, which newcomers will not need to know anything about. Inform 6 sits inside Inform 7, and is part of the inner workings, but is not visible from the outside. For information about Inform 6, see <b>www.inform-fiction.org</b>.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Programming is best regarded as the process of creating works of literature, which are meant to be read... so we ought to address them to people, not to machines. (Donald Knuth, &quot;Literate Programming&quot;, 1981)

<p>
<p>This is the first of about 300 examples in the documentation. In a few cases, such as this one, they provide a little background information, but almost all demonstrate Inform source text. The techniques demonstrated tend to be included either because they are frequently asked for, or because they show how to achieve some interesting effect.
<p>
<p>Many computing books quotes excerpts from programs, but readers have grown wary of them: they are tiresome to type in, and may only be fragments, or may not ever have been tested. The authors of Inform have tried to avoid this. All but two dozen examples contain entire source texts. A single click on the paste icon <img border=0 src=../doc_images/paste.png> (always placed just left of the double-quoted title) will write the complete source text into the Source panel. All that is then required is to click the Go button, and the example should translate into a working game.
<p>
<p>In most cases, typing the single command TEST ME will play through a few moves to show off the effect being demonstrated. (You may find it convenient to create a &quot;scratch&quot; project file for temporary trials like this, clearing all its text and starting again with each new test.)
<p>
<p>Each example is loosely graded by difficulty: if they were exercises in a textbook, the asterisks would indicate how many marks each question scores. As a general rule:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><img border=0 src=../doc_images/asterisk.png> - A simple example, fairly easily guessed.
<br><img border=0 src=../doc_images/asterisk.png><img border=0 src=../doc_images/asterisk.png> - A complicated or surprising example.
<br><img border=0 src=../doc_images/asterisk.png><img border=0 src=../doc_images/asterisk.png><img border=0 src=../doc_images/asterisk.png> - An example needing detailed knowledge of many other aspects of the system.
<br><img border=0 src=../doc_images/asterisk.png><img border=0 src=../doc_images/asterisk.png><img border=0 src=../doc_images/asterisk.png><img border=0 src=../doc_images/asterisk.png> - A complete scenario, containing material not necessarily relevant to the topic being demonstrated.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>In general, the documentation's main text tries never to assume knowledge of material which has not yet appeared, but the trickier examples almost always need to break this rule.
<p>
<p>The examples are intended not only to illustrate specific sections of the documentation, but also to form up into a comprehensive collection of techniques. We thought of this as being like a recipe book, with chapters on items, rooms, and so on, instead of poultry, fish, and the like: and the Recipe Book page, provided in the Documentation panel, shows what the contents page of this alternative book would have looked like.
<p>
<p>As part of the testing process which verifies a new build of Inform, each example in turn is extracted from this documentation, translated, played through, and the resulting transcript mechanically checked. So the examples may even work as claimed. But the flesh is weak, and there are bound to be glitches. We would welcome reports, so that future editions can be corrected.
<p>
<p>At the foot of each example are three icons: from left to right, these close the example, go to the Recipe Book, or go to the alphabetical index.
