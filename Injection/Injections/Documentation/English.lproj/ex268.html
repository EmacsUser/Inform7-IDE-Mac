Creating a scene</b></font></td></tr></table>
<p>
<p>As usual, we only need to say that something is a scene to make it so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Train Stop is a scene.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We conventionally write scene names with capital letters, as this demonstrates.
<p>
<p>This works, and shows up in the &quot;Scenes&quot; index, but does nothing. We have given no instructions on when it begins - no cue, in stage-play terms - so it never will begin, and even if it did, nobody would notice since it does nothing. First, to give it a beginning:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Train Stop begins when the player is in the Station for the third turn.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Every scene has two rulebooks attached, one at each end, so to speak. These look very like &quot;when play begins&quot; and &quot;when play ends&quot;, and work in the same way. Thus:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When Train Stop begins:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move the Flying Scotsman to the Station;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;The Flying Scotsman pulls up at the platform, to a billow of steam and hammering.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When Train Stop ends:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remove the Flying Scotsman from play;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player is in the Station, say &quot;The Flying Scotsman inches away, with a squeal of released brakes, gathering speed invincibly until it disappears around the hill. All is abruptly still once more.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Thus when the scene begins, our imaginary stage-hands wheel in a steam train; when it ends, they get rid of it again. Note that we know where the player will be at the start of the scene, but by the end he may have wandered off across the fields, so we must be careful not to report something he might not be in a position to see.

<p>
<p>The power of scenes lies in their ability to watch for general conditions and move the narrative along whenever these are fulfilled. Instead of waiting for the player to do one specific thing, the game waits for the world to be in a certain condition, before moving to the next stage of the plot.
<p>
<p>For instance, suppose we have a story in which the player has been captured for doing something inappropriate at court and is brought in to await a meeting with a palace official. We want to give the player a few minutes to stew, and we want the scene to end with him doing something mildly peculiar or embarrassing, and the official catching him in the act. So we tempt him into trying any of a number of different kooky activities, and just wait until he falls into the trap...
