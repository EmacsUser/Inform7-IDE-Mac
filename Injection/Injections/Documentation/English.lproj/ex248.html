<p>Stretching a point seasonally, we might write:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn, say &quot;The summer breeze shakes the apple-blossom.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This rule is nameless. It needs no name because it will never need to be referred to: by identifying it as an every turn rule we have already said enough to lodge it in the &quot;every turn&quot; rulebook. In fact, though, it is easy to create a named rule:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">This is the blossom shaking rule: say &quot;The summer breeze shakes the apple-blossom.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The name of a rule must always end with the word &quot;rule&quot;, for clarity's sake. (The phrasing &quot;This is the ... rule&quot; is used because &quot;The ... rule&quot; would be open to misinterpretation.)
<p>
<p>Previously we had a rule which had no name, but belonged to a rulebook: now we have the opposite, because although the &quot;blossom shaking rule&quot; has a name, it has not been placed in any rulebook. That means it will probably never be applied, unless we give specific instructions for that.
<p>
<p>Alternatively, it is possible to both name and place a rule in a single sentence:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn (this is the alternative blossom rule): say &quot;The summer breeze shakes the apple-blossom.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now the &quot;alternative blossom rule&quot; is a named rule in the &quot;every turn&quot; rulebook.

<p>
<p>A thing can have a rule as a property, if we like. Here we are going to allow the player to make a soup whose effects will depend on its ingredients. Each ingredient will have its own &quot;food effect&quot; rule, to be followed when the food is eaten.
<p>
<p>Note that there are other, slightly less cumbersome ways to do the same thing -- we will see in a few sections in the chapter on object-based rulebooks that we could make a &quot;food effects rulebook&quot; and then write a number of rules such as &quot;food effects rule for carrots&quot; or &quot;food effects rule for the stone&quot;. Nonetheless, we demonstrate rules-as-properties here for the sake of thoroughness.
<p>
<p>So:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('&quot;Stone&quot;\n\nA food is a kind of thing that is edible.

<p>
<p>And now to provide some particular foods:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Some carrots are a food. The food effect of carrots is the bright-eye rule. This is the bright-eye rule: now the player is bright-eyed.
</font></blockquote><p>

</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The poison ivy is a food. &quot;Poison ivy grows nearby.&quot; The food effect of poison is the illness rule. This is the illness rule: now the player is ill.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>

</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A person can be well or ill. The player is well.

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of taking the broth: say &quot;You cannot take the broth in your bare hands.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And the following is a relatively unimportant nicety -- the Plurality extension provides some additional adjectives for handling objects with plural names, so we rely on it here:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Include Plurality by Emily Short.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After inserting a food which is not the broth into a container which contains the broth:
