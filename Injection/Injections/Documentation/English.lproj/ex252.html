<p>We often want to arrange for something to happen at some point in the future. Here is yet another timepiece:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('An egg-timer is in the Chamber. &quot;A plastic egg timer in the shape of a chicken can be pressed to set it going.&quot; Instead of pushing the egg-timer: say &quot;It begins to mark time.&quot;; the egg-timer clucks in four turns from now.\n\nWhen the egg-timer clucks: say &quot;Cluck! Cluck! Cluck! says the egg-timer.&quot;\n\n\n')"><img border=0 src=../../doc_images/paste.png></a> An egg-timer is in the Chamber. &quot;A plastic egg timer in the shape of a chicken can be pressed to set it going.&quot; Instead of pushing the egg-timer: say &quot;It begins to mark time.&quot;; the egg-timer clucks in four turns from now.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When the egg-timer clucks: say &quot;Cluck! Cluck! Cluck! says the egg-timer.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The event here is called &quot;the egg-timer clucks&quot;. It only happens if we instruct so, which we do by writing
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">the egg-timer clucks in four turns from now
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>meaning four turns after the turn in which the egg-timer is pushed. We could alternatively describe this future moment as something like &quot;in 18 minutes from now&quot;, or &quot;at 4:15 PM&quot;.
<p>
<p>If we know in advance what time we want something to happen, we can more simply write:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">At 4 PM: say &quot;The great bells of the clock tower chime four.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>

<p>Suppose we want to have a train which, at fixed times, arrives at and leaves stations. It should be possible for the player to get on and off the train when it is stopped, but not while the train is in motion.
