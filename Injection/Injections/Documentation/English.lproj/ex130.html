<p>Inform keeps track of the time of day automatically: play ordinarily begins at 9 AM and each turn takes one minute. In some works of interactive fiction, time of day is crucial: in others, it is irrelevant or even, by a sort of tacit convention, non-existent. So Inform does nothing to act upon the time, or to reveal it to the player, without instruction. Nevertheless it is there.
<p>
<p>A sentence like the following allows the initial time to be set up as something other than 9 AM:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The time of day is 3:13 PM.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Here, &quot;3:13 PM&quot; is a constant value of a kind not seen before: it's a kind of value called &quot;time&quot;, and the value &quot;time of day&quot; is a time that varies. After one turn it will be 3:14 PM, then 3:15 PM and so on.
<p>
<p>Note that the sentence above is an assertion (a statement about the initial state of affairs), not an instruction which can be part of a rule. It would be equivalent to write:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When play begins, change the time of day to 3:13 PM.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We more often use &quot;change the time of day to ...&quot; to take care of drastic events:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When the player loses consciousness:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;change the time of day to 10:12 AM;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;A mist comes over your vision, and when you come to, it is morning and you are in bed.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>

<p>Suppose we wanted a game set in a living town, with locations opening and closing at different times of day, and business carrying on as usual. The point might be to force the player to plan his itinerary carefully to hit the right spots at the right times; or we might be writing a more contemplative piece, where part of the enjoyment came from just watching the characters wander around doing their daily business...
