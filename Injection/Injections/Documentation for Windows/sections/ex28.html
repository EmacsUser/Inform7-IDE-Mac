<p>
<p>Although it is only useful to a limited extent, we can make any number of copies of something:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><script language="JavaScript">
function pasteCode10(code) {
    var myProject = external.Project;

    myProject.selectView('source');
    myProject.pasteCode('"Polygons"\n\nA shape is a kind of thing. A square is a kind of shape. A triangle is a kind of shape.\n\nThe Geometry Lab is a room. In the Geometry Lab are three triangles and two squares.\n\n');
}
</script>
<a href="javascript:pasteCode10()"><img border=0 src=../doc_images/paste.png></a> &quot;Polygons&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A shape is a kind of thing. A square is a kind of shape. A triangle is a kind of shape.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Geometry Lab is a room. In the Geometry Lab are three triangles and two squares.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The description &quot;three triangles&quot; makes three identical things, each of the kind &quot;triangle&quot;, and similarly for the squares. When the above is compiled, the player can type &quot;take two triangles&quot; or &quot;take all the triangles&quot; and so forth.
<p>
<p>Three caveats. Firstly, a counted-out description like &quot;two squares&quot; is only allowed if it combines a number with the name of a kind which is already known (perhaps modified with adjectives, so &quot;two open doors&quot; is fine). If we say:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Two circles are in the Lab.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>without having defined &quot;circle&quot; as a kind in advance, then only a single object will be created - whose name is &quot;two circles&quot;. (This is because many natural names start with numbers: &quot;six of clubs&quot;, for instance, referring to a single playing card, or &quot;12 Hollywood Close&quot; meaning a single house. We wouldn't want such names to be misinterpreted.)
<p>
<p>The second caveat is that excessive duplication is expensive in memory and running time. It is perfectly legal to say
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">In the Lab are 75 triangles.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>but the resulting game may be a little sluggish: and Inform draws the line at 100, refusing to create more duplicates than that in any single place. If we really need more than about fifty duplicated objects - say, a tombola containing raffle tickets numbered 1 to 1000 - it is usually better to find some less literal way to simulate this: for instance, only having a single raffle ticket, but with a randomly chosen number on it.
<p>
<p>Finally: numbers up to twelve may be written out, but larger ones must be written as numerals. So &quot;twelve&quot; or &quot;12&quot;, but &quot;13&quot; only.

<table border=0 bgcolor="#f0f0f0" width=100%><tr><td><font size=2>
<p>
<p>This would be a one-star example if it were not for the repainting:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><script language="JavaScript">
function pasteCode126(code) {
    var myProject = external.Project;

    myProject.selectView('source');
    myProject.pasteCode('"Early Childhood 1"\n\nA building block is a kind of thing. A red block, a blue block and a green block are kinds of building block.\n\nThe Nursery is a room.

}
</script>
<a href="javascript:pasteCode126()"><img border=0 src=../doc_images/paste.png></a> &quot;Early Childhood 1&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A building block is a kind of thing. A red block, a blue block and a green block are kinds of building block.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Nursery is a room. In the Nursery are six red blocks, four blue blocks and a green block.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;look / get red block&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>But a kind cannot change during play, so this will not do. Instead, the colour will have to be a property of the block. So we might first try this:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><script language="JavaScript">
function pasteCode127(code) {
    var myProject = external.Project;

    myProject.selectView('source');
    myProject.pasteCode('"Early Childhood 2"\n\nColour is a kind of value. The colours are red, blue and green. A block is a kind of thing. A block has a colour.

}
</script>
<a href="javascript:pasteCode127()"><img border=0 src=../doc_images/paste.png></a> &quot;Early Childhood 2&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Colour is a kind of value. The colours are red, blue and green. A block is a kind of thing. A block has a colour. A block is usually blue.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Nursery is a room. In the Nursery are six red blocks, four blue blocks and a green block.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;look / get red block&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Which is fine, so far as it goes, but the colour property is not at all visible to the player, who simply sees &quot;eleven blocks&quot;. We thought of colour as being something outwardly apparent, but Inform does not know this. To achieve a better effect, we will need features from distant chapters. The first is an activity called &quot;printing the name of&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><script language="JavaScript">
function pasteCode128(code) {
    var myProject = external.Project;

    myProject.selectView('source');
    myProject.pasteCode('"Early Childhood 3"\n\nColour is a kind of value. The colours are red, blue and green. A block is a kind of thing. A block has a colour. A block is usually blue.

In the Nursery are six red blocks, four blue blocks and a green block.\n\nTest me with "look / get red block".\n\n');
}
</script>
<a href="javascript:pasteCode128()"><img border=0 src=../doc_images/paste.png></a> &quot;Early Childhood 3&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Colour is a kind of value. The colours are red, blue and green. A block is a kind of thing. A block has a colour. A block is usually blue. Before printing the name of a block: say &quot;[colour] &quot;. Before printing the plural name of a block: say &quot;[colour] &quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Nursery is a room. In the Nursery are six red blocks, four blue blocks and a green block.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;look / get red block&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This too, however, is unsatisfactory. The individual blocks are correctly described, but we are unable to distinguish them during play: we cannot type &quot;take a green block&quot;, for instance. And because the blocks are indistinguishable in play, they are still massed together as &quot;eleven blocks&quot; in room descriptions. We need to go one step further:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><script language="JavaScript">
function pasteCode129(code) {
    var myProject = external.Project;

    myProject.selectView('source');
    myProject.pasteCode('"Early Childhood 4"\n\nColour is a kind of value. The colours are red, blue and green. A block is a kind of thing. A block has a colour. A block is usually blue.

Report painting it: say "The block is now [the colour of the noun]."\n\nTest me with "get red block / get blue block / g / i / look / paint blue block red / i / look / paint me red".\n');
}
