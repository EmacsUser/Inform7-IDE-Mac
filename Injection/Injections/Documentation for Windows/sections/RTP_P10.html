<b>P10 - Non-existent property</b>
<p>
<p>Most problems are detected when Inform translates the source text, but this is one of the exceptions, a "run-time problem" which emerges only during play.

Not everything has every property. For instance, a <font color="#000080"><b>room</b></font> cannot have the property <font color="#000080"><b>carrying capacity</b></font>: it would not mean anything. Generally speaking, the properties available to something are specified by its kind. If we say that <font color="#000080"><b>A room has a number called maximum population.</b></font> then the property <font color="#000080"><b>maximum population</b></font> is available to any room. This applies to either/or properties as well: you might say that a room is not <font color="#000080"><b>transparent</b></font>, but Inform takes the firm line that we cannot even ask, because it is meaningless for a room to be either <font color="#000080"><b>transparent</b></font> or <font color="#000080"><b>opaque</b></font>.<p>So, anyway, here it seems that you have tried to access a property for something not allowed to have it.
