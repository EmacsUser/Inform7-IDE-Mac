<p>
<p>Properties can only be given to something if its kind will permit that: we cannot make a chair &quot;dark&quot; or a room &quot;portable&quot;, for instance. When creating kinds, then, we need a way to specify the properties which that kind of thing will allow, and this will need to include new properties of our own devising.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A dead end is either secret or ordinary.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This creates just one new property, not two, as the names are taken as the two states of a single either/or property: secret means not ordinary, ordinary means not secret. Alternatively, we could just say:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A dead end can be secret.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>in which case the opposite of &quot;secret&quot; would be &quot;not secret&quot;.
<p>
<p>Note that we are free to add to the definitions of kinds which already exist, not just those we have created ourselves: for instance,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A room is either indoors or outdoors.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>creates a new property which all rooms either possess or don't. And so on. If we make the above definitions then by default, any dead ends created will be &quot;ordinary&quot; and any rooms created will be &quot;outdoors&quot;: that is, in the absence of other information it is assumed that a new either/or property will not be held. We could reverse this behaviour by adding:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A dead end is usually secret. A room is usually indoors.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(It is not quite true that a property can only be held be something if the kind permits it, because in exceptional cases we can give special permission. For instance, the &quot;openable&quot; property is normally only applicable to doors and containers. Here we give special leave for it to apply to a specific thing:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The umbrella is carried by the player. The umbrella can be openable. The umbrella is openable.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>In practice, this possibility is only occasionally needed.)

<p>Suppose we want to allow the player to go to sleep some of the time:

<blockquote><font color="#000080">A person is either awake or asleep. A person is usually awake.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The important thing to note here is that it does not work to say &quot;the player is either asleep or awake&quot;. This is because the player is not necessarily one specific person or thing during the game: the identity of the player can be changed, as we will see later.
<p>
<p>So if we want to make rules about the properties of the player, we should attach these rules to the &quot;person&quot; kind (or, if they really need to belong only to the player, to the &quot;player-character&quot; kind). A player-character is a kind of person.

</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now a few rules about changing from one state to the other:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of sleeping: now the player is asleep; say &quot;You drop off.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of doing something other than waking up, waiting or sleeping when the player is asleep:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Ssh! You're sleeping!&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of sleeping when the player is asleep:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Zzzz.&quot;

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of waking up when the player is asleep:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the player is awake;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You come to suddenly, wiping drool from your lips.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of doing something other than looking or sleeping when the player is awake:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You'd really rather just sleep through this.&quot;
