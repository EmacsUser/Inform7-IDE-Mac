<b>P18 - Tried to access property for bad value</b>
<p>
<p>Most problems are detected when Inform translates the source text, but this is one of the exceptions, a "run-time problem" which emerges only during play.

When values are defined using a table, the columns of that table become properties. For instance, if the table defines colours and there is a column called <font color="#000080"><b>wavelength</b></font>, it then becomes legal to talk about <font color="#000080"><b>the wavelength of blue</b></font> (supposing that <font color="#000080"><b>blue</b></font> is one of colours defined).<p>Here, an attempt has been made to read or write such a property for something which cannot possibly be a qualifying value - for instance, <font color="#000080"><b>the wavelength of -21</b></font> would be such a case, though many such mistakes are rejected at translation time rather than now.
