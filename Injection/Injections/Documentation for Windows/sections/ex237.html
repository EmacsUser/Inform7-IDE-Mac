Using new kinds of value in properties</b></font></td></tr></table>
<p>
<p>Having created a new kind of value called &quot;brightness&quot;, we are free to use it in the ordinary way like this:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The lantern has a brightness called the flame strength. The flame strength of the lantern is blazing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The &quot;flame strength&quot; property is now only allowed to have one of four values we allowed: guttering light, weak light, radiant light or blazing light. Inform will not allow anything else to be put into it, or allow it to be compared to (say) the number 3.
<p>
<p>However, it seems artificial to call the brightness of the lantern &quot;flame strength&quot;, when we could instead simply call it &quot;brightness&quot;, so we are also allowed this:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The lantern has a brightness. The lantern is blazing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>New kinds of value are very convenient when substituting variations in text:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A dead end is a kind of room with printed name &quot;Dead End&quot; and description &quot;This is a dead end, where crags in the uneven rock are caught by the [brightness of the lantern] flame you hold aloft. Despite [river sound] there is no sign of the stream.&quot; A dead end is usually dark.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The &quot;brightness of the lantern&quot; in square brackets is printed not as literal text, but as whatever the brightness currently is. (This is called a text substitution, and will be the subject of the next chapter.) If the brightness had been a number from 1 to 4, this would have resulted in something like &quot;... by the 3 flame...&quot;, but since it is a new kind of value, the result is &quot;... by the radiant flame...&quot;

<p>
<p>Suppose we have an extremely detailed world model in which every object is characterized by many features -- in this example, material and height, though one could add more. Suppose further that we would like to generate descriptions of these things automatically for the most part, drawing the player's attention only to those aspects of the object that are particularly interesting.

<p>So far the effect is not very deep, but we could take the auto-description a great deal further: providing a larger and more interesting set of variations; or writing a complicated set of rules such that the player only notices height variations when carrying a ruler; or switching between several player-characters, each of whom notices a different subset of characteristics. But these refinements would require more input from later chapters.
