<p>
<p>When inspiration strikes the player, he can usually be relied upon to make a good-faith effort to communicate the new idea: he will guess the right command. If he guesses wrongly, the mistake is probably the author's, because a good author will try to anticipate all possible wordings and make all of them work.
<p>
<p>Nevertheless it is sometimes good practice to nudge the player towards the right wording - particularly if the player has the right idea but is not explicit enough: for instance, typing TALK TO JUDGE when we really want to know what is to be said (JUDGE, GUILTY); or if the player tries something like PLAY CHESS rather than MOVE PAWN TO KING 4. Similarly, if we make a casual reference such as &quot;In your childhood days, you loved sliding in stocking feet across this hallway&quot;, a player might type SLIDE IN STOCKING FEET: a nice idea, and which deserves a nice response, even though it asks to do something beyond the scope of the game.
<p>
<p>Inform provides a simple mechanism for recognising a command but at the same time recognising that <i>it does not properly specify an action</i>. Such commands are called &quot;mistakes&quot;, for the sake of a memorable term, but the player has not really behaved badly, and should be helped rather than reproved. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;act&quot; as a mistake.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>While that works - the command to &quot;act&quot; is indeed rejected - it is not very good, because no very helpful message is brought up. The following is much better:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;act&quot; as a mistake (&quot;To join the actors, you have to adopt a role in the play! Try PLAY HAMLET or similar.&quot;).
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Or we could once again insist on a given context:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;act&quot; as a mistake (&quot;To join the actors, you have to adopt a role in the play! Try PLAY HAMLET or similar.&quot;) when the location is the Garden Theatre.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>That still has the drawback that the command &quot;act hamlet&quot; will not be recognised: so the final version we want is probably
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;act [text]&quot; as a mistake (&quot;To join the actors, you have to adopt a role in the play! Try PLAY HAMLET or similar.&quot;) when the location is the Garden Theatre.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>since the &quot;[text]&quot; part will soak up any words the player types (or none), meaning that any command at all whose first word is &quot;act&quot; will be matched.
<p>
<p>The following is often useful during beta-testing of a new work, though we would not want it in the final published edition. Many authors like to ask their testers not to try anything in particular, simply to play naturally: but to record the transcript of the session, and email it back to the author. The following command is a device to allow the tester to type a comment in to the transcript:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;! [text]&quot; as a mistake (&quot;Noted.&quot;).
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>For instance, the tester might type &quot;! DIDN'T WE SAY DARCY WAS TALL?&quot;, to which the game would reply &quot;Noted.&quot; - and the author can search for such comments when receiving the transcript.
<p>
<p>If we are careful, we can make the reply depend on what was typed in the mistaken command:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;steal [something]&quot; as a mistake (&quot;Just TAKE [the noun] and leave without paying: that's stealing in my book.&quot;).
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The care comes in because Inform applies much less checking to mistakes than to other actions, and odd errors will result if we try to refer to (say) &quot;the second noun&quot; in a command which did not have a second noun.
