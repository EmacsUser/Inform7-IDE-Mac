Inform 7 Mac IDE
Written by Andrew Hunter

This is a copy of the official Mac IDE source code, which is available
at http://inform7.com/sources/interfaces/. The author's git repository
is http://code.logicalshift.co.uk/inform/inform.git.

I am cloning it in Github because I keep forgetting where to find it.

The IDE application is licensed under the GPL v2. For details, see
Distribution/license.rtf.

The "master" branch (which you're looking at right now) was last updated
April 22, 2009. This is not current; bugs appeared on MacOS 10.7. More
current code is in the "hunter" branch (Andrew Hunter's "master").
There's also "vnext" and "xcode4", which is the most recently updated
branch. I'm not sure which represents the Mac binary on the Inform web
site.

Build notes (I haven't tested them):
