<p>
<p>The containers and supporters created so far have been boundlessly capacious: or rather, though we seldom notice the difference, have had a maximum carrying capacity of 100 items. This is clearly unrealistic for a small purse or a modest mantelpiece. We can impose upper limits with sentences like so:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">The carrying capacity of the jewelled purse is 2.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">The bijou mantelpiece has carrying capacity 3.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>Attempts by the player to overfill, or overload, will now be rebuffed with a message such as &quot;There is no room on the mantelpiece&quot;.
<p>
<p>The player is not a container or a supporter, but a special sentence is allowed to specify the maximum number of items which can be carried at once:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">The carrying capacity of the player is 4.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>This exact form of the sentence must be used, and for reasons which will not be clear until later on (when we get to &quot;player-characters&quot;, a special kind of person of which the player is normally the only example), it is otherwise very unwise to talk about &quot;the player&quot; as if it were a thing like &quot;the jewelled purse&quot;.
