<p>
<p>Everything has one and only one kind: but kinds can have more specific kinds. We have in fact seen this already. Inform makes the world out of two fundamental kinds, &quot;room&quot; and &quot;thing&quot;: the other kinds seen so far, &quot;container&quot;, &quot;supporter&quot; and &quot;door&quot; are all kinds of thing.
<p>
<p>A new kind must be created as a special case of an existing one. Here we sub-categorise rooms:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">A dead end is a kind of room.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>Any dead end that we make is also a room, but can also have other properties in addition, if we so decide. For the purposes of this example, it's useful to mention a property not seen so far: rooms can be &quot;dark&quot; or &quot;lighted&quot;, all the examples so far having been lighted. Similarly, a thing with the property of being a &quot;light source&quot; will enable the player to see inside dark rooms, and to carry out other activities requiring light, such as examining items.
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">A dead end is a kind of room with printed name &quot;Dead End&quot; and description &quot;This is a dead end. You'll have to go back the way you came.&quot; A dead end is usually dark.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">The Undertomb is a dark room. East is a dead end. South is a dead end with printed name &quot;Collapsed Dead End&quot;. Northwest is a dead end called the Tortuous Alcove.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">In the Undertomb is the candle lantern. It is a light source.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>Three different rooms adjoin the Undertomb as a result. Notice how much more concise this is thanks to having the &quot;dead end&quot; kind to hand.
<p>
<p>The word &quot;usually&quot; is new here. By saying that a dead end is usually dark, we are saying that it will be dark rather than lighted unless we should specify otherwise. So it would be fine to add:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">The Tortuous Alcove is lighted.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>because although dead ends are usually dark, this one is an exception. On the other hand, if we had originally written
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">A dead end is always dark.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>then Inform would not have permitted any exception to be made, and would have reported a problem if we had tried to make the Tortuous Alcove lighted. Besides &quot;usually&quot; and &quot;always&quot;, we can also employ &quot;seldom&quot; and &quot;never&quot;, which as might be expected are their negatives. Thus, &quot;never lighted&quot; means the same as &quot;always dark&quot;.
<p>
<p>What is a kind, really? In the end it is a name for a bundle of properties, and the key differences between a kind (such as &quot;container&quot;) and a property (such as &quot;fixed in place&quot;) are that, firstly, something only has one kind (except in the sense that a container is also a thing, and so on), and secondly, it has that kind forever, whereas properties may change.
