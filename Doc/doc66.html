<p>
<p>Clocks and watches vary considerably in how much detail they show, and we tend not to report the time over-precisely: half-past ten is an elastic concept. The following room description for the Clock Chamber comes across much more naturally:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">The Clock Chamber is a room. &quot;The dark chamber behind the clock face, a mill-room of gears which grind down the seconds. Through the glass you can see the reversed hands reading [the time of day to the nearest five minutes in words].&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>The phrase &quot;... to the nearest ...&quot; rounds off the given time, just as it sounds. For instance, &quot;9:58 PM to the nearest ten minutes&quot; is 10:00 PM. As this shows, we can also quote lengths of time, not just times of day: for instance &quot;7 hours&quot;, &quot;one hour 14 minutes&quot;, or &quot;90 minutes&quot; all validly describe durations. We never (ordinarily) deal in periods of time longer than a single day.
