The source text was successfully translated to produce the story file, and the &quot;cblorb&quot; packaging tool was then used to wrap it up into a Blorb archive, the standard run-time format produced by Inform.

<p>
Blorbs produced by Inform have a .zblorb extension - they are Z-machine story files wrapped up in blorbs. In principle they can be played by any standards-compliant Z-machine interpreter on any computer, but a few interpreters do not understand blorb wrappings: if you need to use one of these, go to the Settings panel for the project and untick the &quot;Create a Blorb archive for release&quot; box, then release again. The result will be just a bare story file, probably with a .z5 or .z8 file extension, but none of the advanced release options (solutions, website, cover art, etc.) will be possible, and the bibliographic data will also be lost.
