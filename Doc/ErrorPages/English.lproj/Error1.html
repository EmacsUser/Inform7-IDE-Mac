<body><font face="lucida grande,geneva,arial,tahoma,verdana,helvetica,helv" size=2><b>Translating the Source - Failed</b><p>
The application ran your source text through the Inform 7 compiler, as usual, but the compiler unexpectedly failed. This should not happen even if your source text is gibberish, so you may have uncovered a bug in the program.
<p>
When a Mac OS X program like the I7 compiler fails, it typically returns a numerical error number: this time, the error code was 1, so I7 probably stopped because of a fatal file-system error.
<p>
It is very unlikely that your computer is at fault. More likely causes are:
<p>
<UL TYPE=SQUARE><LI>disc space running out on the volume holding the project;</LI>
<LI>trying to run a project from a read-only volume, such as a burned CD or DVD;</LI>
<LI>trying to run a project which belongs to another user, whose files you have no permission to alter.</UL>
</LI></UL>
<p>
However, if you think it more likely that the Inform 7 compiler is at fault, please check that you have the currently distributed build of the system: if you have, please consider taking the time to fill out a bug report form and email it to the author.
<p>
<center><b>Sorry for the inconvenience.</b></center>
