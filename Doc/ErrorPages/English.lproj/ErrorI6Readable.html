<body><font face="lucida grande,geneva,arial,tahoma,verdana,helvetica,helv" size=2><b>Translating the Source - Out of Readable Memory</b><p>
The application ran your source text through the Inform 7 compiler, as usual, and it found no problems translating the source. This process results in what's called a &quot;story file&quot;, which is a program for a small virtual computer. Unfortunately, the story file for this source text broke a fundamental limit in this virtual computer: the maximum space available for &quot;readable memory&quot;, which really means the space available in which to store tables, rulebooks, things, rooms and dictionary words.
<p>
Inform can produce story files for several different virtual computers, and the one used by the current project can be selected using the Settings panel. If you are currently using the &quot;version 5 Z-machine&quot;, you could try trading up to version 8, but this may not help - both versions have the same limit, more or less. If you are able to switch the project to the Glulx virtual computer, then limits like this will probably not bother you again, but Inform has (at present) only limited support for Glulx, and if you can <i>nearly</i> squeeze your intended design into the Z-machine, then it is probably a good idea to make the necessary economies and do so.
<p>
There is advice on economising in Chapter 2 of the documentation.
