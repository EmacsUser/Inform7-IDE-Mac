<b>Run-time problem</b>
<p>
<p>Not all problems can be detected at compile time, that is, when the Go or Replay buttons are clicked. Some emerge only during play, and these are called "run-time problems".
<p>
<p>Here a problem arose because you tried to move a backdrop to a specific place or item. Backdrops can, in principle, begin play in any combination of the rooms, and most backdrops never move at all - they are like a fixed painted backcloth in a stage set. If they do move, the restriction is that they can only move to single regions, and this restriction seems to have been broken here.
