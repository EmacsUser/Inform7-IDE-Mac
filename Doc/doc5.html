<p>
<p>The language used in the source reads as if it were English aimed at a human reader (and this is intentional: the designer, after all, is a human reader and needs to be able to understand his or her own source), but in reality Inform can only understand a very modest range of sentences and will complain if its limits are passed. Subtler problems arise if the source contains contradictions. For instance, the following &quot;Problem&quot; might be produced:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">>--> You wrote 'A starting pistol is in the cup' (Midsummer Day, line 3), but in another sentence 'A Panama hat is on the cup' (Midsummer Day, line 4): the trophy cup cannot both contain things and support things, which is what you're implying here. If you need both, the easiest way is to make it either a supporter with a container attached or vice versa. For instance: 'A desk is here. On the desk is a newspaper. An openable container called the drawer is part of the desk. In the drawer is a stapler.'</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>This is a rather discursive error message, and a similar problem were to occur in the same run through, it would be curtailed to:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">>--> You wrote 'A firing pistol is in the box' (Midsummer Day, line 5), but in another sentence 'A fedora hat is on the box' (Midsummer Day, line 6): again, the croquet box cannot both contain things and support things.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>Because error messages can be rather lengthy, they are transcribed to a log file called the 'Log of problems' (the last state of which can be seen in the Problems tab). In some cases even longer messages are produced, and these go to the log only. For instance:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">>--> You wrote 'erase the bottle' (Midsummer Day, line 56): but this is a phrase which I don't recognise, possibly because it is one you meant to define but never got round to, or because it's one you haven't used in a while and whose wording you haven't remembered correctly. (See the 'Log of problems' file for a complete run-down of the current phrasebook.)</font></blockquote>
