<p>
<p>The phrase &quot;say&quot; is a way to print up something on screen. We can use it to print one thing alone:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">say &quot;Hello!&quot;;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>In practice it is much more convenient to use substitutions once again:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">say &quot;Please proceed to [the destination] where [prize total] points are available to the diligent player.&quot;;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>This is equivalent to:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">say &quot;Please proceed to &quot;, the destination, &quot; where &quot;, prize total, &quot; points are available to the diligent player.&quot;;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>(which would also work). So we would end up reading something like
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">Please proceed to Marley Wood where 12 points are available to the diligent player.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>Other sorts of things you can say are demonstrated by:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">say &quot;Your score is now [total score in words] thanks to having acquired [the treasure item] from [a donor]. [The treasure item] is well worth having.&quot;;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>which might, assuming the above values all make sense, produce something like:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">Your score is now thirty-two thanks to having acquired the plover's egg from a giant. The plover's egg is well worth having.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>Line breaks are automatically printed accordingly to the following simple rule: if a quoted piece of text ends with a full stop, a question mark or an exclamation mark, then a new-line is added; and otherwise not. Thus the sentence just quoted is printed with a new-line, but this would not be:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">say &quot;reddish jar&quot;;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>If you have a further sentence to print without breaking the paragraph, this works nicely:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">say &quot;The lawn spreads wide and green. &quot;;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>because the full stop is the penultimate character, not the last.
