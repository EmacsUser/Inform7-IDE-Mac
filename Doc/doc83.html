<p>
<p>There are often several slightly different ways to perform a given task but which have substantially the same definition. In the following example:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">To go hiking, into the woods or up the mountain:<br>if into the woods then say &quot;Watch out for badgers.&quot;;<br>if up the mountain then say &quot;Better take your compass.&quot;;<br>say &quot;You go hiking.&quot;.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>...a phrase has been set up which can be used in three ways:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">go hiking;<br>go hiking, into the woods;<br>go hiking, up the mountain;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>Note that commas must be used to divide these &quot;phrase options&quot; from the rest of the text of the phrase. Within the definition of the phrase, the option's name is a valid condition, and
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">if up the mountain then ...</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>is true if the phrase was called with &quot;up the mountain&quot; specified and false otherwise, in the obvious way. A more substantial example from the standard rules is given by the Inform list-writer, which produces lists of things to specifications we choose. For instance:
<p>
<p>list the contents of Marley Wood, as a sentence, with newlines
<p>and including all contents;
<p>
<p>Note that this phrase is allowed to have multiple options specified, whereas &quot;go hiking&quot; above was not: this is because it was defined thus:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">To list the contents of (something - an object), with newlines, indented, as a sentence, including contents, including all contents, giving inventory information, giving brief inventory information, using the definite article, listing marked items only, prefacing with is/are and/or not listing concealed items: ...</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>The significant difference is the word &quot;and/or&quot; instead of &quot;or&quot;, which signals that more than one option can apply at a time.
