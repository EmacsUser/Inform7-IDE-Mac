<p>
<p>Welcome to Inform 7, a design system for interactive fiction based on natural language. This is a preview release running on Mac OS X Panther through the graphical user interface created by Andrew Hunter. The main window has two panels side by side, and the wall between them can be dragged back and forth, like the slide on a trombone. Each panel can display one of a number of displays relevant to the current project, one of them being the Documentation visible now. Switch between them with the side tabs on the right-hand edge of each panel.

<p>Interactive fiction is a literary form which involves programming a computer so that it presents the user with a text which can be explored. Inform aims to make the burden of learning to program such texts as light as possible, and moreover to live up to Donald Knuth's doctrine (&quot;Literate Programming&quot;, 1981) that:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">Programming is best regarded as the process of creating works of literature, which are meant to be read... so we ought to address them to people, not to machines.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>This new release of Inform is a radical departure from most previous approaches to interactive fiction, though in some ways it harks back to early work on AI such as &quot;Shrdlu&quot;, and it is still experimental. I should like to dedicate it to Emily Short and Andrew Plotkin, whose shrewd and sceptical contributions made a contribution which can hardly be overstated. Though a command-line version of Inform 7 will eventually be released, I have thought of it throughout in combination with a radically more humanising user interface: all credit for this reference implementation, which I hope will be imitated on other platforms, belongs to Andrew Hunter.
<p>
<p>Inform 7 is very different to Inform 6, which newcomers will not need to know anything about. For information about Inform 6, please turn to <a href=http://www.inform-fiction.org/>www.inform-fiction.org</a>.
