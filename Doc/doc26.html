<p>
<p>As the following examples show, sentences can make several assertions at once by using the plural. Suppose we have defined a kind called &quot;high-up fixture&quot;, for instance like so:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">A high-up fixture is a kind of thing. A high-up fixture is usually fixed in place.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>
<p>Then the following sentence creates two such objects and puts them in their place:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">The high shelf and the skylight window are high-up fixtures in the Lumber Room.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>since it is equivalent to saying:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">The high shelf is a high-up fixture. The skylight window is a high-up fixture. The high shelf is in the Lumber Room. The skylight window is in the Lumber Room.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>
<p>Such plurals are allowed in almost any context, and we could even define two kinds at once:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">Bucket and basket are kinds of container.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>(This isn't the same as plural object names in the sense of the Inform game parser, which I hope to implement later. Plurals are generated automatically, according to a fairly simple algorithm looking at word endings, and which is quite easy to fool if you insist on trying. For instance, invent a kind called &quot;trees&quot;, and its plural &quot;treeses&quot; will come into being as well. At some point there will be a way to specify a plural if it would otherwise be wrong.)
