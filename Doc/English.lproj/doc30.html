<p>As we have just seen, making something &quot;fixed in place&quot; will prevent it from being picked up or moved. But it remains substantial enough to be described in its own paragraph of text when the player visits its location. This can be unfortunate if it has also been described already in the body of the main description for that location. For instance, if we wrote:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Orchard is a room. &quot;Within this quadrille of pear trees, a single gnarled old oak remains as a memory of centuries past.&quot; The gnarled old oak tree is fixed in place in the Orchard.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This would end up describing the oak twice, once in the paragraph about the Orchard, then again in a list of things within it:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><b>Orchard</b>
<br>Within this quadrille of pear trees, a single gnarled old oak remains as a memory of centuries past.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">You can see a gnarled old oak tree here.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We avoid this by making it &quot;scenery&quot; instead of &quot;fixed in place&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The gnarled old oak tree is scenery in the Orchard.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Any thing can be scenery, and this does not bar it from playing a part in the game: it simply means that it will be immobile and that it will not be described independently of its room.
