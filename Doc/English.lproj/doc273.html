<p>
<p>This chapter is about what to do when we have a complete, finished work on our hands.
<p>
<p>There is a thriving community of readers and writers of interactive fiction, and it is sometimes supported by grants from arts foundations and other cultural bodies: there's increasing attention from the academic world, and a general consensus has gradually grown that interactive fiction is a &quot;valid&quot; artistic medium for expression. Like poetry, it is something that a few people like a lot, and which most people can see the point of, even if they don't read it themselves. Over the last thirty years, a few authors have established durable reputations: they give occasional newspaper interviews, and have a very low-key kind of fame. There are competitions, and annual awards ceremonies. Newcomers are always welcome.
<p>
<p>With a small number of exceptions, though, the most important works of interactive fiction have never been &quot;published&quot; in the sense of being issued for sale by a for-profit company. They have instead been uploaded to &quot;the IF archive&quot;, which is the nearest we have to an Alexandrian Library of all the world's interactive fiction, past and present; and have been talked about, and reviewed, on two long-standing Usenet newsgroups - <b>rec.arts.int-fiction</b> and <b>rec.games.int-fiction</b>.
<p>
<p>For the most part, IF has not been commercially valuable since about 1988. Successful authors of IF generally take the view that while they could, perhaps, make a very modest amount of money from sales, it would be a nuisance to collect and make no meaningful difference to their incomes; it would cut the number of readers, whereas one wants the satisfaction of being read; and besides, the whole culture of IF has always been characterised by giving and sharing. (Inform itself is free.)
<p>
<p>Inform has nevertheless occasionally been used to produce commercial works (generally add-ons or bonuses to other games), and users are welcome to sell works created by Inform with no royalty or requirement for rights clearance.
