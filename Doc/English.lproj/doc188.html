<p>
<p>Here is another rather definitive, immutable-looking table:
<p>
<p><center><img src=table9.tiff></center>
<p>
<p>But table entries can be changed as freely as variables: that is, any value can be entered so long as it has the right kind. We cannot put a dynasty into the &quot;Name&quot; column, or text in the &quot;Accession&quot; column. The phrase needed is &quot;change ... to ...&quot;, just as it is for properties or variables:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Dynasty is a kind of value. The dynasties are Stuart, Hanover, Saxe-Coburg-Gotha and Windsor.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Succession is in the Table Office. &quot;But the Succession, a ponderous list of English monarchs, takes pride of place.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of examining the Succession: say &quot;The Succession List runs as follows...&quot;; repeat with N running from 1 to the number of rows in the Table of Recent Monarchs begin; say &quot;[accession in row N of Table 4]: [name in row N of Table 4] ([family in row N of Table 4]).&quot;; end repeat.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of attacking the Succession: change (the family corresponding to an accession of 1720 in the Table of Recent Monarchs) to Stuart; change the name in row 4 of the Table of Recent Monarchs to &quot;Graham I&quot;; change the name in row 5 of the Table of Recent Monarchs to &quot;Trixibelle IV&quot;; say &quot;You deface the English succession, making suitable amendments with a quill pen. Considering it is supposed to be mightier than the sword the effect is a little disappointing.&quot;
