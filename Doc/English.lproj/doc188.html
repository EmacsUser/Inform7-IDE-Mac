<p>The special definitions in the previous section have a further effect. When we define:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: A container is large if its carrying capacity is 10 or more.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>we not only say how to test if something is large (see if its capacity is at least 10) and how to create something large (give it a capacity of exactly 10), we also create a new form of comparison. Thus,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the basket is larger than the thimble ...
<br>if the thimble is not larger than the basket ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>are both true. If we also define &quot;huge&quot; and &quot;small&quot;, as in the previous section, we also get comparisons &quot;huger than&quot; and &quot;smaller than&quot;. Note that &quot;huger than&quot; has exactly the same meaning as &quot;larger than&quot;: we can use whichever wording seems more natural. (For bacilli, for instance, we would probably not say &quot;huger than&quot;, even though the meaning would be unambiguous.)
<p>
<p>We can also compare two things to see if they share the same value of a property. For instance, to go back to the heights example, once we define &quot;tall&quot; and &quot;short&quot;, we get that exactly one of the following will be true:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if Adam is taller than Eve ...
<br>if Adam is the same height as Eve ...
<br>if Adam is shorter than Eve ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Though it will not always seem natural wording, we can use the comparison &quot;the same P as&quot; for any property P which has a value. Do we think &quot;if the basket is the same carrying capacity as the thimble&quot; is good English? Maybe, maybe not. But we are always at liberty to spell things out in full:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the carrying capacity of the basket is the carrying capacity of the thimble ...
</font></blockquote><p>
