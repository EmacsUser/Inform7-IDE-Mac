<p>
<p>In every example so far, and in almost all practical cases, the first word in a command which results in an action will be something fixed: a verb, in fact. When we write
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;photograph [something]&quot; as photographing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>we are saying that the first word of such a command will always be &quot;photograph&quot;. Occasionally, though, we would like to understand a noun as a command, perhaps in a situation where the command is obvious. If we say:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;[something]&quot; as examining.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>then the command &quot;examine&quot; will be implicit when the player types a bare noun:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A red box and a blue ball are here.
<br>> ball
<br>The blue ball is plaited from many small leather patches.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>so that the command &quot;ball&quot; has resulted in the action &quot;examining the blue ball&quot;.
<p>
<p>This is a feature which should be used sparingly, since it could easily lead to confusion if not carefully explained to the player. By default, it is not used at all.

<p>
<p>The original Adventure allowed the player to type the names of rooms in order to move to them, and it is now not too difficult for us to do the same. Adventure restricted this option to adjacent rooms, but we might want to be a bit more flexible, so we will accept any room:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('Understand &quot;[any room]&quot; as going by name.

Understand &quot;go to [any room]&quot; as going by name.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Going by name is an action applying to one thing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We should reject movement to the player's current location, or to anywhere he hasn't been and can't see:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Check going by name:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the noun is the location, say &quot;You're already in [the location].&quot; instead;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the noun is not adjacent and the noun is unvisited, say &quot;That noun did not make sense in this context.&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The assumption here is that the player does know the names of the rooms adjacent to his current location, even if he hasn't been there yet.
<p>
<p>Now for the travel itself. The simplest way to ensure that the usual movement rules will still apply is to convert GO BY NAME into a GO action, and here the best route comes to our aid:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out going by name:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let aim be the best route from the location to the noun, using doors;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if aim is not a direction, say &quot;You can't think how to get there from here.&quot; instead;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;(heading [aim])[line break]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try going aim.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This will allow the player to travel toward rooms he has already visited even if they are several moves away.
<p>
<p>Finally, so that the player can also use the names of doors as commands:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;[door]&quot; as entering.
</font></blockquote><p>
