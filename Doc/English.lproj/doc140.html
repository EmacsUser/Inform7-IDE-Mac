<p>We now run through a few special phrases which control other phrases: causing them to repeat, perhaps, or to be skipped. These phrases are equivalent to the &quot;control structures&quot; of other computer programming languages: no system for interactive fiction can possibly be adequate unless it allows us to carry out arbitrary computations, so the pretence that Inform is not really a programming language must dropped sooner or later. That time is now.
<p>
<p>The phrase:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if (... condition ...) then (... another whole phrase ...)
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>causes the phrase after &quot;then&quot; to be followed only if the condition holds. Some people prefer to use a comma, which is treated just the same:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if (... condition ...), (... another whole phrase ...)
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>There are many different forms of condition in Inform (and, as we shall see, we can easily add more), but the simplest is:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">(first value) is (second value)
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>As always, Inform checks that these two values are of kinds which can be compared. The following will produce an objection, for instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if 10 is a door then say &quot;Huzzah!&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>since it makes no sense to ask the question, and the only result will be the baffled reply:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><b>Problem.</b> In the line 'if 10 is a door then say &quot;Huzzah!&quot;' <img src=../Reveal.tif>, I can't determine whether or not '10 is a door', because it seems to ask if a number is some sort of door.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This, however, would be fine:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To comment upon (whatever - a thing): if whatever is transparent then say &quot;I see right through this!&quot;; if whatever is an open door then say &quot;Oh look, an open door!&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>since &quot;whatever&quot; is known to be a thing, and Inform knows that things are indeed sometimes transparent and sometimes open doors.
