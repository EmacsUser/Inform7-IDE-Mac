<p>
<p>The two I7 versions of &quot;while&quot; are defined in the Standard Rules as follows:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">To while (c - condition) repeatedly (ph - phrase): (- while {c} {ph} -).</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">To while (c - condition) begin *: (- while {c}  -).</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>The second case is the one which involves a block of code, to be ended later with an &quot;end while&quot;. The asterisk signals to I7 that such a block is expected. The I6 code should be such that an I6 code block, starting and ending with a brace, can legally follow it.
<p>
<p>Variables can be created as part of a loop which exist only within it. All that needs to be done is to supply their type and declare them to be &quot;variable&quot;:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">To repeat with (loopvar - number variable) running from (v - number) to (w - number) begin *: (- for ({loopvar}={v}: {loopvar}<={w}: {loopvar}++)  -).</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">To repeat with (loopvar - object variable) running through contents of (v - object) begin *: (- objectloop ({loopvar} in {v})  -).</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>I7 will compile this using a local variable for &quot;loopvar&quot;: it may well re-use this variable later for other loops, so its value cannot be relied upon outside of the code block following the loop.
