<p>
<p>Scenes are not only useful for changing the setting, by moving items or people around and providing a little narration. We can also make the rules different in one scene from another. For instance, at a sleepy country halt there is no reason why one should not walk across the tracks: but if there is a train in the way, that would be impossible.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before going north during the Train Stop, say &quot;The train blocks your way.&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Any rule can have the clause &quot;during ...&quot; attached, provided that clause goes at the end and explicitly names a scene. This is especially useful with &quot;every turn&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn during the Train Stop, say &quot;Water is sluiced out of the tank and into the engine.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We can test whether a scene is happening with the condition:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Train Stop is happening ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>and there are similar conditions &quot;Train Stop has happened&quot; and &quot;Train Stop has ended&quot;. We need to be a bit careful about which we mean: it's possible to set things up so that the Train Stop scene will play out more than once, so &quot;Train Stop is happening&quot; and &quot;Train Stop has happened&quot; might both be true at once.
