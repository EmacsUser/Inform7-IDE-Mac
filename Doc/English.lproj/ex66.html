<p><b>1. When it happens.</b> The obituary is the text &quot;*** You have died ***&quot; or similar, usually followed by the final score.
<p>
<p><b>2. The default behaviour.</b> Printing the aforementioned text, then the final score, and reducing the status line to a largely blank state.
<p>
<p><b>3. Examples.</b> (a) For a work with no meaningful score, it would be odd to wind up with a final reckoning of 0, so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('Procedural rule: ignore the print final score rule.\n\n\n')"><img border=0 src=paste.png></a> Procedural rule: ignore the print final score rule.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(b) Or we could add to the verdict:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('After printing the player\'s obituary: say &quot;And you visited [number of visited rooms] place[s].&quot;\n\n\n')"><img border=0 src=paste.png></a> After printing the player's obituary: say &quot;And you visited [number of visited rooms] place[s].&quot;

<p>
<p>Occasionally, a piece of IF is sufficiently serious that it feels bathetic to offer the player the usual restore-restart-undo-quit options at the end. The following would replace &quot;*** You have died ***&quot; with a centered epitaph, then quit the game when the player hits a key.
<p>
<p>This example relies on a standard extension to avoid any fancy programming:
