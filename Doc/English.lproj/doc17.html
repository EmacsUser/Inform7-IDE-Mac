<p>
<p>It seems unwise for a door in Notting Hill to be unlocked, so:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">The blue door is lockable and locked. The matching key of the blue door is the brass Yale key.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>Since the second sentence here is a little clumsy, you can equivalently say
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">The brass Yale key unlocks the blue door.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>Yet a third way to say this is:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">The blue door has matching key the brass Yale key.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>(In effect, &quot;has&quot; and &quot;have&quot; mean &quot;is with&quot;.) This introduces three new properties: a door can be locked or unlocked; lockable or not lockable; and it can have a matching key, which must be another thing. The same thing can be the matching key of many different locks: and note that a door can be locked and even lockable without having a matching key at all, in which case the player trying to open it will be permanently out of luck. Doors are ordinarily unlocked, not lockable, and without a matching key.
<p>
<p>Containers can also have locks, in exactly the same way, and are allowed to have the same properties. On the other hand supporters never have locks: it makes no sense to be able to lock a tabletop, for instance, and Inform will not allow any discussion of the matching key of a supporter, or of a supporter being locked or unlocked.
