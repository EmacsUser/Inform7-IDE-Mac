<p>
<p>Activities are all about influencing the standard mechanisms which Inform uses, so it might at first seem that there is no need to create new activities: but on further reflection, quite a lot of the writing of interactive fiction involves creating new and systematic ways to do things, and as soon as we have a general rule, we will want to have exceptions. Inform therefore allows us to create our own activities, giving us ways to influence the operation of our own mechanisms.
<p>
<p>There are two kinds of activity: those which relate to a specific thing or room, and those which do not. The following creates one of each kind:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Analysing something is an activity.
<br>Assaying is an activity.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Here &quot;analysing something&quot; relates to a specific item: Inform knows this because it looks for the clue &quot;something&quot; (or &quot;of something&quot;) after the activity's name, which in the first case above is simply &quot;analysing&quot;.
<p>
<p>Creating an activity is like creating an action: it automatically makes new rulebooks - &quot;before analysing&quot;, &quot;for analysing&quot; and &quot;after analysing&quot; - but they start out empty, so the activity does nothing yet. Moreover, it never happens. We can make an activity happen at any time by writing phrases like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">carry out the analysing activity with the pitchblende;
<br>carry out the assaying activity;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>To make the activity do something useful, we need to put a rule into its &quot;for&quot; rulebook:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The last for assaying rule:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Professionally, you cast an eye around mineral deposits nearby, noticing [list of rocks in the location].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>&quot;The last&quot; is a technicality about rulebooks (see the next chapter) which, put briefly, guarantees that this rule comes last among all possible &quot;for assaying&quot; rules. This is good form because the whole point of an activity is to make it easy for further rules to interfere - so we deliberately hang back to last place, giving precedence to anybody else who wants it.
<p>
<p>It may look rather pretentious to dress up the footling little &quot;assaying&quot; example as an activity, but it gains us more than might first appear. Every new activity created provides a context which other activities can observe. We could, for instance, define
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for printing the name of a rock while assaying: ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>so that during assays more technical names are used.
