<p>Although it is only useful to a limited extent, we can make any number of copies of something:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('&quot;Polygons&quot;\n\nA shape is a kind of thing. A square is a kind of shape. A triangle is a kind of shape.\n\nThe Geometry Lab is a room. In the Geometry Lab are three triangles and two squares.\n\n\n')"><img border=0 src=paste.png></a> &quot;Polygons&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A shape is a kind of thing. A square is a kind of shape. A triangle is a kind of shape.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Geometry Lab is a room. In the Geometry Lab are three triangles and two squares.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The description &quot;three triangles&quot; makes three identical things, each of the kind &quot;triangle&quot;, and similarly for the squares. When the above is compiled, the player can type &quot;take two triangles&quot; or &quot;take all the triangles&quot; and so forth.
<p>
<p>Two caveats. Firstly, a counted-out description like &quot;two squares&quot; is only allowed if it combines a number with the name of a kind which is already known (perhaps modified with adjectives, so &quot;two open doors&quot; is fine). If we say:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Two circles are in the Lab.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>without having defined &quot;circle&quot; as a kind in advance, then only a single object will be created - whose name is &quot;two circles&quot;. (This is because many natural names start with numbers: &quot;six of clubs&quot;, for instance, referring to a single playing card, or &quot;12 Hollywood Close&quot; meaning a single house. We wouldn't want such names to be misinterpreted.)
<p>
<p>The second caveat is that excessive duplication is expensive in memory and running time. It is perfectly legal to say
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">In the Lab are 75 triangles.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>but the resulting game may be a little sluggish: and Inform draws the line at 100, refusing to create more duplicates than that in any single place. If we really need more than about fifty duplicated objects - say, a tombola containing raffle tickets numbered 1 to 1000 - it is usually better to find some less literal way to simulate this: for instance, only having a single raffle ticket, but with a randomly chosen number on it.
