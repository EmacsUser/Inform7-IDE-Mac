<p>When a numerical value is given in a square-bracketed substitution, it is ordinarily printed out in digits. Thus:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;You've been wandering around for [turn count] turns now.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>might print as &quot;You've been wandering around for 213 turns now.&quot;, if the game has been played out for exactly that many commands. Alternatively, we can add &quot;...in words&quot;, thus:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;You've been wandering around for [turn count in words] turns now.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>to get the more conversational &quot;You've been wandering around for two hundred and thirteen turns now.&quot;
<p>
<p>Either way, though, there is some risk of the following:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">You've been wandering around for one turns now.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We can avoid this using the special substitution &quot;[s]&quot;, which prints a letter &quot;s&quot; unless the last number printed was 1. So:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;You've been wandering around for [turn count in words] turn[s] now.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>will produce &quot;... for one turn now.&quot; or &quot;... for two turns now.&quot; as appropriate. This only solves one case (what about all the other plural endings, from &quot;women&quot; to &quot;cherubim&quot;?), and as we shall see we can get the same effect and very much more using the methods in the next section, so &quot;[s]&quot; is something of an anomaly. But it's memorable, and even if it only solves one small need, this is a need which turns up often.
