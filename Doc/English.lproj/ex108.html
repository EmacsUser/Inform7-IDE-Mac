<p><b>1. When it happens.</b> &quot;Scope&quot; is a term of art in interactive fiction programming: it means the collection of things which can be interacted with at any given moment, which depends on who you are and where you are. Commands typed by the player will only be allowed to go forward into actions if the things they refer to are &quot;in scope&quot;. Inform also needs to determine scope at other times, too: for instance, when deciding whether a rule conditional on being &quot;in the presence of&quot; something is valid. It is a bad idea to say anything during this activity.
<p>
<p><b>2. The default behaviour.</b> Is complicated: see the Inform Designer's Manual, 4th edition, page 227. Briefly, the scope for someone consists of everything in the same place as them, unless it is dark.
<p>
<p><b>3. Examples.</b> (a) We very rarely want to forbid the player to refer to things close at hand, but often want to allow references to distant ones. For instance, a mirage of something which is not present at all:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After deciding the scope of the player while in the Shrine: place the holy grail in scope.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The special phrase &quot;place ... in scope&quot; does what it suggests. Ordinarily if something is placed in scope, then so are its parts and (in the case of a room, a supporter or a transparent or open container) its contents; but we can also &quot;place the box in scope, but not its contents&quot; if we really need to place just the box itself in scope.
<p>
<p>(b) Another useful device is to be able to see, but not touch, another room:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('The Cloakroom is a room. &quot;This is just a cloakroom, but through a vague, misty mirror-window you can make out the Beyond.&quot; After looking in the Cloakroom, say &quot;In the mirror you can see [list of things in the Beyond].&quot;\n\nAfter deciding the scope of the player while in the Cloakroom: place the Beyond in scope.\n\nThe Beyond is a room. Johnny Depp is a man in the Beyond.\n\n\n')"><img border=0 src=paste.png></a> The Cloakroom is a room. &quot;This is just a cloakroom, but through a vague, misty mirror-window you can make out the Beyond.&quot; After looking in the Cloakroom, say &quot;In the mirror you can see [list of things in the Beyond].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After deciding the scope of the player while in the Cloakroom: place the Beyond in scope.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Beyond is a room. Johnny Depp is a man in the Beyond.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(This must, however, also be a mirage, as at time of writing Mr Depp is alive, well and playing Willy Wonka in the forthcoming movie of &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;.)
<p>
<p>(c) In darkness, the scope of someone is ordinarily restricted to his or her possessions (and body), but we can override that:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After deciding the scope of the player while in darkness: place the location in scope.

<p>
<p>A map of linked rooms works well for modeling enclosed or indoor space, and somewhat less well for modeling large open spaces, where a person should reasonably be able to see things which are much too far away to touch. With some modifications to scoping, though, we can create an environment where objects in nearby rooms are described and viewable, and where the player will automatically move towards distant items before interacting with them physically.

of value. 10 feet 11 inches specifies a height. 10 feet 11 specifies a height. The verb to stand (it stands, they stand, it is standing) implies the height property. The verb to measure (it measures, they measure) implies the height property. A thing has a height. The height of a thing is usually 3 feet 0.\n\nDefinition: a thing is tiny if its height is 0 feet 6 inches or less.\n\nDefinition: a thing is short if its height is 3 feet 0 or less.\n\nDefinition: a thing is tall if its height is 6 feet 0 or more.\n\nThe height of a man is usually 5 feet 10 inches.

The lily pond is fixed in place in the Middle Terrace. &quot;You [if going]come to[otherwise]are at[end if] the north edge of a perfectly round lily pond, bordered with stones. Its surface patchily reflects [the marble anteater] on the south bank.&quot; A tent peg and a wilted orchid are in the Middle Terrace. The tent peg measures 0 feet 6.

The height of marble anteater is 6 feet 2 inches. &quot;A marble anteater stands on a pedestal at the top of the hill. In the bright sunlight the white marble makes a striking contrast with [the obelisk] in the distance.&quot; The description is &quot;The anteater is very much more than life-size.&quot;\n\nThe obelisk of black granite is a fixed in place thing in the Upper Terrace. &quot;Now that you are at the foot of it, you can properly appreciate the stupid immensity of the obelisk, pointing stonily at heaven.&quot; The height of the obelisk is 50 feet 0 inches. The description of the obelisk is &quot;It stands ridiculously tall, and has an inscription on the face.&quot;\n\nThe inscription is part of the obelisk. The height of the inscription is 0 feet 3 inches. The description of the inscription is &quot;You can\'t read the squirming, pointed letters, but they make you uneasy.&quot;.\n\nThe Gravel Circle is west of the Upper Terrace, northwest of the Middle Terrace, and north of the Croquet Ground. The description of the Gravel Circle is &quot;[if going]You head [noun] until the lawn thins and[otherwise]Here the lawn[end if] gives way to a circle of raked gravel, which crunches pleasingly beneath you.&quot;\n\nInstead of going northwest in the Upper Terrace, try going north.\n\nThe Ha-ha is north of the Gravel Circle and northwest of the Upper Terrace. The description of the Ha-ha is &quot;[if going]The land dips here so suddenly that you do not know the dip is there until you\'re in it; but it prevents livestock from crossing barriers, and that is the important thing[otherwise]You are at the base of a steep-sided depression, so the lawn continues north and south more or less at the level of your head[end if].\n\nThe tip of [the obelisk] is the only thing you can make out from this depression, off to the southeast.&quot;. North of the Ha-ha is the Sheep Field. In the Sheep Field is an animal called a black sheep. The black sheep stands 4 feet 3 inches. &quot;A black sheep grazes placidly nearby.&quot; The description of the black sheep is &quot;It reminds you of your Uncle Tim.&quot;\n\nBefore going from the Ha-ha:\n\tsay &quot;It\'s a bit of a scramble to get back up the side of the depression, and you keep slipping in the damp grass. But you manage at last.&quot;\n\nThe Rose Garden is  southwest of the Lower Terrace. The thicket of red roses is a fixed in place thing in the Rose Garden. The thicket stands 4 feet 2 inches. &quot;Heavy red roses grow over a roughly horseshoe-shaped wall around you. Over this barrier, the head of [the marble anteater] is visible to the northwest, and the tip of [the obelisk] in the distance.&quot;\n\nThe description of the Rose Garden is &quot;[if going]You slip [noun] into the enclosure of the rose garden. [end if]The rest of the park, and the world, seems muted and quiet.&quot;\n\nInstead of smelling the rose garden: try smelling the roses. Instead of smelling the roses, say &quot;The smell tickles the back of your throat and makes you want to cough.&quot;\n\nInstead of listening to the rose garden:\n\tsay &quot;You can\'t hear anything at all.&quot;\n\nThe Open Lawn is north of the Rose Garden, west of the Lower Terrace, and southwest of the Middle Terrace. The Croquet Ground is north of the Open Lawn, west of the Middle Terrace, southwest of the Upper Terrace, and northwest of the Lower Terrace.\n\nA discarded champagne cork is in the Open Lawn. It stands 0 feet 2 inches.\n\nA stone bench is an enterable supporter in the Croquet Ground. It stands 3 feet 8 inches. &quot;There is a stone bench here -- a sort of stone sofa, really, with nymphs disporting themselves on the arms and back.&quot; The description of the bench is &quot;It used to be a Roman sarcophagus -- hence the nymphs -- but someone has thoughtfully recarved it as lawn furniture.&quot;\n\nThe half-size Bentley is a vehicle in the Gravel Circle. &quot;A sort of child\'s-toy version of a Bentley is parked [if something parkable is in the location]beside [the tallest parkable thing in the location][otherwise]here[end if].&quot; The description of the half-size Bentley is &quot;Of beautiful and unambiguously luxurious lines, but sized down to hold only one or (at a stretch) two people, and powered by electricity.&quot; The half-size Bentley stands 3 feet 6 inches.\n\nDefinition: a thing is parkable if it is not a person and it is not the Bentley.\n\n')"><img border=0 src=paste.png></a> &quot;Stately Gardens&quot;

<p>We also need to tell distant rooms how to describe themselves.
<p>
