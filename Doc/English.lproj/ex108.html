<p>
<p>As first appeared some chapters ago, actions are created like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Photographing is an action applying to one visible thing and requiring light.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Depositing it in is an action applying to two things.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We can qualify &quot;thing&quot; as either &quot;visible thing&quot; or &quot;touchable thing&quot;, the default being the latter, and of course the two applicable objects do not need to have the same condition attached:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Waving it at is an action applying to one touchable thing and one visible thing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Thus to &quot;wave magic wand at banyan tree&quot;, the player must be able to lay hands on the wand, but need only be able to see the tree.
<p>
<p>There are also actions without objects:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Taking inventory is an action applying to nothing.
</font></blockquote><p>

<p>
<p>Using the compass directions in commands is a little bit finicky because directions are forbidden to figure in any interactions involving touch. (Really, directions are more a concept than an object; this is a compromise situation.) In any case, if we want to write a new command involving these, we need to be sure to specify that the direction is a visible thing. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Eddystone&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Lighthouse is a room. &quot;A lonely place, but in these tense times, no one but the lighthouse keeper and a few trusted agents are allowed on the grounds at all, for fear of sabotage.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The light is a fixed in place thing in the Lighthouse.  &quot;At the center of the room is the light itself, a 1000-Watt tungsten halogen light powered by diesel generator, and having a visible range of twenty-six nautical miles.&quot; Understand &quot;lamp&quot; as the light. It is lit. The light has a property called heading. The heading of the light is north.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A room is usually dark.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;turn [something] [a direction]&quot; as reorienting it to. Reorienting it to is an action applying to two things.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>will give us
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">>turn light northeast
<br>You must name something more substantial.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>To avoid this mystifying result:
<p>

<p>
<p>And now that's done, we have a little fun calculating where the beam hits:
<p>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;change the heading of the light to the second noun;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let way be the heading of the light;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let place be the room way from the Lighthouse;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while place is a room and place is lower than Lighthouse
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let place be the room way from the place;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end while;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if place is not a room, remove the beam from play;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise move beam to the place.
