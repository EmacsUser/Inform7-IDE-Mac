<p>
<p>In every example so far, and in almost all practical cases, the first word in a command which results in an action will be something fixed: a verb, in fact. When we write
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;photograph [something]&quot; as photographing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>we are saying that the first word of such a command will always be &quot;photograph&quot;. Occasionally, though, we would like to understand a noun as a command, perhaps in a situation where the command is obvious. If we say:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;[something]&quot; as examining.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>then the command &quot;examine&quot; will be implicit when the player types a bare noun:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A red box and a blue ball are here.
<br>> ball
<br>The blue ball is plaited from many small leather patches.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>so that the command &quot;ball&quot; has resulted in the action &quot;examining the blue ball&quot;.
<p>
<p>This is a feature which should be used sparingly, since it could easily lead to confusion if not carefully explained to the player. By default, it is not used at all.
