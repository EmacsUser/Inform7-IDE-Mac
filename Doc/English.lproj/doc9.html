<p>Designing an interactive fiction can be divided into two related activities. One is the creation of the world as it appears at the start of play: where and what everything is, and how the different locations connect together. Given this alone, Inform would create nothing more than a simulation: the player will be able to explore, move things around and carry out a limited number of mundane tasks (unlocking doors, say, or switching on lights) but nothing surprising will happen. No lost keys will be found in the bellies of fish, nor will anything spontaneous happen. The second aspect of design, then, will be describing the unusual things which happen: the rules of play which liven things up.
<p>
<p>The same division into two is visible in Inform source text. Some of the sentences make unconditional factual statements about the world: for example,
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">The wood-slatted crate is in the Gazebo. The crate is a container.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>Inform calls sentences like this one &quot;assertions&quot;. The verb is almost always &quot;is&quot; (or &quot;are&quot;), written in the present tense. The world described is the starting condition of the game: what happens when play begins is another matter. The crate will always be a container, but if somebody picks it up and walks off with it then it will no longer be in the Gazebo.
