<p>Whereas the Skein is a braid of all the lines so far explored, with the individual commands thought of as &quot;knots&quot;, it shows only what was typed in: not what responses came from that. The Transcript shows both commands and responses, but can only do so for a single thread through the Skein: it always shows the one currently selected in the Skein panel, in fact, which is the one most recently played unless we choose otherwise. A typical portion of Transcript looks like so:
<p><p><img src=Trans1.png><p>
<p>As this shows, the transcript has two columns: the left shows what was actually printed, while the right shows what should have been printed. If they match, the command's text is coloured green. We can tell Inform what &quot;should have been&quot; printed by using the &quot;Bless&quot; button, which tells it that the text printed this time was in fact correct.
<p>
<p>On the other hand, if the response printed differs from the &quot;blessed&quot; correct version, the command turns red and the variation is underlined:
<p><p><img src=Trans2.png><p>
<p>
<p>Some writers of IF like to work backwards from a transcript of the game they want to produce, and for them, this feature will be helpful as a running picture of what works so far. Other authors may not use the Skein/Transcript feature at all until right at the end of a project, in testing before publication, when it becomes very important to be able to make small changes in one area without upsetting everything else. Either way, the Skein and Transcript together make a very powerful testing aid.
