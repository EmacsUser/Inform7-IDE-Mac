<p>The skein is a radical new feature in recent test releases of Inform, and the documentation is not written yet. Briefly, the idea is that they automatically record the different sequences of commands one tries when exploring a game for testing purposes: using the diagram in the Skein panel, one can then automatically replay these sequences against updated versions of the game, and so on.
<p>
<p>Moving the mouse over a command in the Skein panel causes a cluster of little icon buttons to appear. Andrew Hunter writes:

<p>&quot;The three buttons that work are mostly pretty obvious: add, delete and lock. 'Unlocked' items will eventually be tidied up automatically: this is to try to keep the skein under control when playing manually through the game many times. The limit may be a bit high at the moment, so this won't happen often. It basically works on the width of the skein. 'Locked' items should never be deleted. The two states are distinguished by the colour of the lock icon (yellow for unlocked, green for locked) and the colour of the lines linking skein items together (blue for unlocked, black for locked).
<p>
<p>The two that don't work, in the upper left corner, will eventually provide some control over the 'extra' data stored with the skein. The button that looks like a 'play' button will link to the transcript window: I haven't fully worked out the details of this yet, but the idea is to show a single flat branch of the skein with both commands and responses. The user will be able to add 'expected' responses as well, the idea being that you can design the game by writing a transcript, have the skein follow along with the commands, and then test your code to see how well it fits as you go. (The trick is, of course, ensuring that it's obvious how the transcript and the skein relate to each other). The other button will provide a more simple means of annotating the skein: it will add an annotation above a particular item. I also plan to change the background colour of the skein from that point down to the bottom (highlighting the entire branch). The idea is to make it easy to find particular areas of the game while scrolling around with a large skein.&quot;
