<p>
<p>So far every &quot;Understand&quot; sentence has ended with &quot;as&quot; and a description of an action. But we can also use &quot;Understand&quot; to supply new ways to express values, as in the final paragraph of the following example game.
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Palette&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">The Atelier is a room. &quot;The floridly untidy loft space used by a moderately unsuccessful artist (you, that is).&quot; The canvas, palette and paint brush are here. Understand &quot;painting&quot; as the canvas.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">Colour is a kind of value. The colours are white, red, blue and green.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">The canvas is allowed to have a colour. The canvas is white. The printed name of the canvas is &quot;largely [colour] canvas&quot;.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">Painting is an action applying to one thing and one colour. Check painting: if the noun is not the canvas then say &quot;Centuries of tradition suggest that canvas is the natural home of paint.&quot; instead. Carry out painting: change the colour of the canvas to the colour understood. Report painting: say &quot;You splash away at the now [canvas].&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;paint [something] [a colour]&quot; as painting.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;calico&quot; as white. Understand &quot;cerulean&quot; or &quot;cerulean blue&quot; as blue.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>Similarly, we might conceivably want to allow new ways to recognise numbers:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;eleventy-one&quot; as 111.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>Whereas we did not need to say:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;canvas&quot; as the canvas. Understand &quot;red&quot; as red. Understand &quot;111&quot; as 111.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>since these are all done automatically.
