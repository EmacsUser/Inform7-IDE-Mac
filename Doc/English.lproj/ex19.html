<p>The map of an interactive fiction is the layout of rooms and the entrances and exits which connect them. So far, these map connections have always run from one room to another, like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Painted Room is north of the Undertomb.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>However, we can also interpose doors between rooms, like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The heavy iron grating is east of the Orchard and above the Undertomb. The grating is a door.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The second sentence is needed since otherwise Inform will take &quot;heavy iron grating&quot; to be the name of a third room, whereas what we want is for the grating to be something physically present in both the Orchard and in the Undertomb, and acting as a conduit between them. To this end it needs to be a &quot;door&quot;, a kind we have not so far seen. In the absence of any other instruction, a newly created door will be fixed in place, closed and openable.
<p>
<p>Inform's &quot;door&quot; kind can be used for all manner of conduits, so the word door need not be taken literally. In Ursula K. LeGuin's beguiling novel &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot;, from which the above rooms are stolen, it is not a grating which interposes, but:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The red rock stair is east of the Orchard and above the Undertomb. The stair is an open door. The stair is not openable.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>In real life, most doors are two-sided, and can be used from either of the rooms which they join, but this is not always convenient for interactive fiction. Here is a one-sided door:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The blue door is a door. It is south of Notting Hill. Through it is the Flat Landing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(Note the use of &quot;it&quot; here as an optional abbreviation.) This will make a door visible only on the Notting Hill side; no map connection will be made in the reverse direction, unless we ask for one.
<p>

<table border=0 bgcolor="#e0e0e0" width=100%><tr><td><font face="lucida grande,geneva,arial,tahoma,verdana,helvetica,helv" size=2><a name="e19"><a href=doc33.html#e19><img border=0 src=../FlipOpen.png></a> <font color="#800000"><b>Example</b> (*).</font> <i>Adding the door and the deck to our charter boat.</i><p>
<p>
<p>We mentioned that there is a door out to the deck in our example. The following two sentences will create both the door and the other room:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('The cabin door is south of the Cabin and north of the Deck. It is a door and scenery.\n\n\n')"><img border=0 src=paste.png></a> The cabin door is south of the Cabin and north of the Deck. It is a door and scenery.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now Inform has constructed a generic room called &quot;Deck&quot; to the south. It has neither a description nor any contents yet, but we could fix that in time. It does have a view of the glacier, though, since we defined the glacier view to be everywhere.
