<p>Inform is not comprehensive, nor was meant to be. It actively supports &quot;extensions&quot;, to promote sharing and good practice, and the creation and circulation of extensions is a flourishing part of Inform culture. Why go to great trouble to (say) work out how to make doors open automatically as needed, when somebody else has already perfected this?
<p>
<p>It is probably best for newcomers to steer clear of extensions until they have some practical experience of designing simple works, but there is nothing difficult about using extensions, and a few brief notes are worth giving here. (The final chapter of this manual gives a more comprehensive account, and covers the writing of new extensions.)
<p>
<p>Extensions are identified by name (say &quot;Following People&quot;) and also by author (say &quot;Mary Brown&quot;). These will probably be downloaded from the Internet as needed, or exchanged by email, but they need to be installed before they can be used. On Mac OS X, this means storing them in the folder
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">~/Library/Inform/Extensions/
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>where &quot;~&quot; signifies your home folder. (This folder will probably need to be created using the Finder.) Each author has a subfolder of this folder, and his or her extensions live inside it. Our example extension should therefore be placed as:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">~/Library/Inform/Extensions/Mary Brown/Following People
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(no filename extension is used). In case it may be helpful for experimentation, Emily Short's useful extension &quot;Locksmith&quot; comes built into Inform and need not be downloaded and installed.
