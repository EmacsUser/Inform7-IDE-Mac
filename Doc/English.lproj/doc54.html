<p>What does &quot;is&quot; mean? There was much amusement when this became an issue in the absurd Senate trial of President Clinton, but the definition of &quot;to be&quot; spans a heroic twelve columns in the Oxford English Dictionary.
<p>
<p>Some descriptions are exact, in referring unambiguously to a specific thing whatever the circumstances: but most are vague. If we go back to:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The cargo trunk is an openable container.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This sentence tells us that an exact description (the cargo trunk) &quot;is&quot; a vague one (an openable container). Here &quot;is&quot; means &quot;has a place among the things distinguished by a specified quality&quot; (OED meaning 9b: Inform also allows 9a and 9c but not 9d, for any OED junkies reading this). Inform also makes use of the more complicated meaning &quot;to have or occupy a place somewhere&quot; (OED 5a), as in
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The cargo trunk is in the attic.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>On the other hand, Inform will reject
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The cargo trunk is the oak tree.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And this is not inconsistent, because although it looks the same, here we have a different meaning of the verb &quot;to be&quot;: &quot;to exist as the thing known by a certain name; to be identical with&quot; (OED 10).
<p>
<p>We might call these meanings &quot;matches&quot; and &quot;equals&quot; for short, and they behave very differently when we come to conditions. Consider:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">... if the noun is the cargo trunk ... (&quot;equals&quot;)
<br>... if the cargo trunk is an openable container ... (&quot;matches&quot;)
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Most computer programming languages would strictly distinguish them: Perl, for instance, would write &quot;=~&quot; and &quot;==&quot; respectively. But Inform follows English and writes &quot;is&quot; for both meanings, and for the OED 5a meaning too, as we saw in only the previous section:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: a room is occupied if a person is in it.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The condition buried in here is &quot;a person is in it&quot;. Here &quot;is&quot; stands for a deceptively complicated question, involving not only the specific thing (the room) but also everything else in the world (the possible occupiers), and putting constraints on both things involved - one having to be a room, the other a person. Not bad for just five words.
<p>
<p>This all sounds like a pedantic digression, and perhaps it is. (A 9b &quot;is&quot;, by the way.) But it has a moral: that &quot;is&quot; can do far more than the simple value comparisons offered by most computer programming languages.
