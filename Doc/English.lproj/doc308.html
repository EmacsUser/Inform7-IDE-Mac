<p>Some commentators on IF suggest that it arose directly from the invention of role-playing game in the 1970s, when the nineteenth-century tabletop war-game collided with the potent cult of J. R. R. Tolkien in American college campuses. It is certainly true that Will Crowther, co-author of what is generally regarded as the first true work of IF, had been an early player of E. Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson's prototype role-playing game &quot;Dungeons and Dragons: Rules for Fantastic Medieval Wargames Campaigns Playable with Paper and Pencil and Miniature Figures&quot; (1974) - later, more snappily, just D&D. On the other hand, surprisingly few IF authors in the last thirty years have adopted styles of play which resemble RPGs at all closely; and the book-keeping, the randomness, the simulationist nature, the volume of detail and the open-endedness implied by a &quot;campaign&quot; all make the implementation of a RPG in interactive fiction something of a technical challenge. So that is what we are going to do: or at least we will work through enough of a system of RPG-like rules to demonstrate the possibility.
<p>
<p>This example aims to show how more traditional computer-programming techniques might sit in an Inform project, since it involves rather more in the way of algorithms and exotic data structures than a typical literary piece of IF.

<p>
<p>The name &quot;Woodpulp and Wyverns&quot; is meant to imply that this is a rough imitation of the various late-1970s rulebooks on offer: besides D&D, one might also mention &quot;Tunnels and Trolls&quot; by Ken St Andre (crazy name, crazy guy). We want the W&W rules to be written not for any specific game, but to be available to a potentially unlimited range of scenarios. We also want to show how that might be itself extended, because the typical RPG spawns a huge litter of add-on packs and extra rulebooks. So the top-level headings of the project divide it up into Part I, general rules, Part II, an example set of extension rules, and Part III, a playable scenario: the idea is that when the whole thing works nicely enough, Parts I and II can be extracted into Inform extensions, and then anybody who wants to can use them to devise their own scenarios.

</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We will need the concept of material later. The exceptional status of air is recorded in a comment rather than enforced with a sentence like &quot;A thing is never air&quot; because Inform dislikes assertions which are not logically equivalent to positive precise statements (it allows &quot;A thing is never closed&quot;, but only because that amounts to saying &quot;A thing is always open&quot;).
<p>
<p>The verb phrase &quot;to be made of&quot; is on the face of it only a shorthand, but our biggest aim in writing the source text is to make it look like normal English prose - we think it will be more understandable, and therefore more likely to work first time, if it reads naturally.

<p>
<p>RPGs are games of chance as well as skill, and the actual rolling of the dice is as much a part of the experience as the randomised outcome. The polyhedral four-, six-, eight-, ten-, twenty- and even hundred-sided dice ubiquitous to RPGs are pleasingly exotic in the hand, but also make possible a wide range of random distributions. W&W uses the traditional notation for such rolls (which evolved as the D&D rules went through successive printings, but became standard around 1980): &quot;3d6+2&quot; means we should roll three six-sided dice, add up the scores showing, then add 2. We added the pointless verb &quot;roll&quot; as a harmless convenience for testing that die rolls work:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">> ROLL 3D6+2
<br>For your own amusement, you roll 3d6+2: 2,5,4+2=13, making thirteen.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The optional nature of the adds part of a die roll means that &quot;2d4&quot;, for instance, is also a legal form. Again, this is a convention imitating the tables which appear in printed RPG rulebooks.

<p>This is the first of several tables which, again, mimic the style of typical RPG manuals. That mimicry makes no difference to the game as it is perceived by the eventual player, but it helps us to write the source text. Spells are going to cost a certain number of strength points to cast, and will come in various categories: some apply to some particular item (the &quot;targeted&quot; ones), others do not. Most need the caster to be holding something of a particular material nature: for instance, &quot;the requirement of magic missile&quot; evaluates to &quot;wood&quot;. This is where our dummy material, &quot;air&quot;, comes in: it effectively specifies that there is no material requirement for the given spell. (Were the above an ordinary table, a blank entry &quot;--&quot; would do for this, but it is not an ordinary table - it is defining properties associated with values, so is not permitted to leave any properties unspecified.) Lastly, the final sentence is provided so that American players can use the -ize spelling and English players -ise: it means that the value &quot;memorise&quot; (in the source it is spelled -ise) can be typed in either form by the player at run-time.

<p>
<p>In a typical RPG, each participant other than the referee (usually called the &quot;Dungeon Master&quot; or &quot;Game Master&quot;, and here the computer) keeps numerical scores of a number of &quot;attributes&quot;. Here we confine ourselves to only two: strength, &quot;STR&quot;, and experience, &quot;EXP&quot; (which is actually kept in Inform's ordinary score variable). One becomes weaker by performing magic or being wounded, stronger by resting or being healed; one gains experience by living a busy life. These tallies matter a lot, so we make them prominently visible at all times on the status line - the bar at the top of the screen.
<p>
<p>Each time the player takes inventory, we are requiring the computer to work out how to look through the table of spells in cost order, which is a little inefficient - but it causes no perceptible delay in play. We don't list the spells in the right order to start with because we can't be bothered, and because it would be problematic when we come to add extension rules later on; and we don't sort the table in cost order at the start of play because we are not allowed to disturb the ordering of a table which defines properties attached to values.

<p>This part of the source is intended to be self-explanatory, and the first paragraph is placed first because is the more concise of the two expressions of the same idea. When we tell Inform the rule, in the third paragraph, we are more exact - we make clear that negative costs are not allowed. Note that the third paragraph makes &quot;strength cost of S to Mr X&quot; meaningful for any spell S, but that it is calculated each time, and is not a property like &quot;nature of S&quot;.

<p>
<p>This is the first half of the longest section in the chapter. &quot;Casting it at&quot; is an unusual action because it can take two forms, having a sort of transitive and intransitive version: one casts &quot;detect trap&quot; with no target, but &quot;magic missile&quot; must be aimed at something. Inform permits actions to have syntax which leaves a noun optional, but requires that we supply any missing nouns so that by the time the action is processed nothing is missing. We construe a missing target for a spell as being the current location: thus, &quot;detect trap&quot; is actually a spell cast on the ambient surroundings, which seems reasonable enough.
<p>
<p>The variable &quot;current spell focus&quot; typifies something which tends to happen in complex sequences of rules: later rules need to refer to something worked out in the course of an earlier rule. That means the sort of &quot;let ...&quot; variable will not do, because it is too temporary - it expires when the earlier rule finishes, so will be gone when the later rule is reached. Here we put the value into a permanent variable. This might be problematic if one casting action could be interrupted by another one, but here that never happens.
<p>
<p>The can't magically attack a warded person rule is a little sloppy: it does not sap the magical strength of the victim to cast the spell, which - if sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander - it perhaps should.

<p>
<p>Surprisingly, these are the complete carry out and report rules for this action, but only because they use a more powerful mechanism to allow for more flexible reporting than would ordinarily be possible: they create a new rulebook, &quot;Effect&quot;, whose task is to carry out the spell and also to set &quot;current spell outcome&quot; to a suitable message about what happens.

<p>
<p>The &quot;Effect&quot; rulebook is unavoidably complicated, given what it is expected to do, but we mitigate this by having provided as many convenient shorthands (such as &quot;record outcome&quot;) as possible. A few points to note here: we have to write &quot;Effect of casting fashion staff at:&quot;, with the &quot;at&quot; even though this is a spell not aimed at anything, because of our original design decision to have a single casting action &quot;casting it at&quot;. A pity, but it's a small price to pay. The curious line &quot;now the current spell focus is magic-imbued wood&quot; looks so curious because of the somewhat irregular way the word &quot;wood&quot; behaves in English - we say that a key is &quot;metal&quot;, using the same word for the substance (noun) as for the state of being it (adjective), but with &quot;wood&quot; we eccentrically say &quot;wooden&quot;. If we cared enough about this, we could doubtless teach Inform to understand &quot;now the current spell focus is magic-imbued-wooden&quot;, but it turns out we don't care enough about this.
