<blockquote><font color="#000080">I think this will be more useful for some chapters than for others -- Rules, for instance, can use a lot of explaining about what they're for, and Activities. I try to give some hints about what various things are for in the examples, so some of that material is folded in, but it might not hurt to provide conclusions and guidelines. [ES]
