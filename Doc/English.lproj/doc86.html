<p>Going is an action defined like any other: it is the one which happens when the player tries to go from one location to another. But it is unlike other actions because it happens in two locations, not just one, and has other complications such as vehicles and doors to contend with. To make it easier to write legible and flexible rules, &quot;going&quot; is allowed to be described in a number of special ways not open to other actions, as demonstrated by the following example game:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Going Going&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Catalogue Room is east of the Front Stacks. South of the Catalogue Room is the Musicology Section.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of going nowhere from the Front Stacks, say &quot;Bookcases obstruct almost all passages out of here.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of going nowhere, say &quot;You really can't wander around at random in the Library.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before going to the Catalogue Room, say &quot;You emerge back into the Catalogue Room.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Note that &quot;going nowhere&quot; means trying a map connection which is blank, and if no rules intervene then &quot;You can't go that way&quot; is normally printed. Unless &quot;nowhere&quot; is specified, descriptions of going apply only when there is a map connection. So &quot;going from the Musicology Section&quot; would not match if the player were trying to go east from there, since there is no map connection to the east. Similarly, &quot;going somewhere&quot; excludes blank connections.
<p>
<p>The places gone &quot;from&quot; or &quot;to&quot; can be regions instead of rooms. This is convenient when there are several different ways into or out of an area of map but a common rule needs to apply to all: so, for example,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before going from the Cultivated Land to the Wilderness, ...
<br>Before going nowhere from the Wilderness, say &quot;Tangled brush forces you back.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(Note that it must be &quot;going nowhere from the Wilderness&quot;, not &quot;...in the Wilderness&quot;.)
