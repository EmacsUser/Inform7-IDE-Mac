<p>
<p>In interactive fiction, it is conventional to ask other characters to do something like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">> marcel, put the biscuit in the tea
<br>> will, go west
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>and so on. Clearly &quot;will, go west&quot; should not produce the same action as &quot;go west&quot;, because a different person will be trying it: this person is called the &quot;actor&quot;, and while the actor is ordinarily the player, here it is the character of Will. The actions produced are:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">> go west -> going west
<br>> will, go west -> asking will to try going west
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We can thus write rules like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of asking will to try going west, say &quot;Will scratches his head, baffled.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>which apply only to the command &quot;will, go west&quot; and do not affect the command &quot;go west&quot;. Actions carried out by other people get as far as completing the &quot;instead&quot; rules but then, if no rule has intervened by then, fail like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">> will, go west
<br>Will has better things to do.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Similarly, we can also have phrases like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">try asking the Sybil to try waiting
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>which simulate the player having typed &quot;sybil, wait&quot;.
