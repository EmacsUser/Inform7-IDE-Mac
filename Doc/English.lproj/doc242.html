<p>As was mentioned earlier, the same extension is sometimes requested several times. For instance, suppose the main source text asks to include version 2 of extension X, and also to include extension Y. Suppose further that Y contains a request to include version 4 of X. We now have two different requests for X. Inform works out the minimum version number needed to satisfy these requests (in this case 4) and gives an error if the extension it actually loads turns out to be earlier.
<p>
<p>This is especially useful when it comes to the Standard Rules. Suppose an extension is written which works with version 3 or later of the Standard Rules, but not with version 2. All the extension needs to do is to say:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Include version 3 of the Standard Rules by Graham Nelson.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>If an extension does include other extensions, it should do so in a paragraph immediately following the introductory sentence, so that anyone looking at the file can see these mutual dependencies at a glance.
