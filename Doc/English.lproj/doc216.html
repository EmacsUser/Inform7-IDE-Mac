Phrases concerning rules</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>The &quot;ignore&quot; phrase is only one of a suite. The full list is:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">ignore ...rule...
<br>reinstate ...rule...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The &quot;reinstate&quot; phrase simply reverses any previous &quot;ignore&quot; of the same rule, and is otherwise not useful.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">reject the result of ...rule...
<br>accept the result of ...rule...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Some rules produce results (see below), but they can be set so that whatever result they produce will be ignored. Again, &quot;accept ...&quot; simply undoes a previous &quot;reject ...&quot; and otherwise has no effect.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">substitute ...first rule... for ...second rule...
<br>restore the original ...second rule...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Whenever the second rule is to be invoked - from any rulebook, or as a result of any &quot;follow&quot; instruction - invoke the first one instead. Again, &quot;restore ...&quot; simply undoes the effect of an earlier &quot;substitute&quot;.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">move ...first rule... to before/after ...second rule...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This causes the first rule to be ignored whenever it turns up in the ordinary way, but to be invoked either immediately before or immediately after the second rule whenever that second rule is invoked. In effect, it cuts out the first rule from wherever it was, and glues it onto the second. Note that there is no obligation for the first rule to begin in the same rulebook(s) as the second, so this can be used to slot in a wholly new rule, perhaps only if certain circumstances hold.
<p>
<p>These rule-changing instructions allow quite casual sentences to wreak havoc with the model world. This, for instance, is quite the recipe for mayhem and perplexity:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A procedural rule: reject the result of the before rules; ignore the after rules; move the after rules to before the before rules.
</font></blockquote><p>
