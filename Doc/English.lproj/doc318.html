<p><i>What goes wrong:</i>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>Office on Floor Fifty-One
<p>Your office. Recent remodeling efforts have left it positively spacious, with only nothing as permanent features.
<p>
<p>You can see a creature and a cage (empty) here.
<p>
<p>>x creature
<p>It's an attractive shade of red, really, when you think about it, and scaly.
<p>
<p>>x red creature
<p>It's an attractive shade of red, really, when you think about it, and scaly.
<p>
<p>>touch scaly creature
<p>Keep your hands to yourself!
<p>
<p>>touch furry creature
<p>You can't see any such thing. [so far so good]
<p>
<p>>ask creature about e
<p>I didn't understand that sentence. [but this is problematic]
<p>
<p>>ask creature about me
<p>I didn't understand that sentence.
<p>
<p>>purloin creature
<p>[Purloined.]
<p>
<p>>put creature in cage
<p>I didn't understand that sentence. [as is this]
<p>
<p>>put all in cage
<p>creature: Done.
<p>
<p>>look
<p>
<p>Office on Floor Fifty-One
<p>Your office. Recent remodeling efforts have left it positively spacious, with only nothing as permanent features.
<p>
<p>You can see a cage (in which is a creature) here.

<p><i>Comments:</i>
<p>
<p>
<p>If I bracket out
<p>
<p>[Understand &quot;scaly&quot; as the creature when the creature is scaly. Understand &quot;furry&quot; as the creature when the creature is not scaly.]
<p>
<p>then put... and ask... act as they ought.
