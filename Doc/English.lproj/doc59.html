<p>We have already seen that the names for either/or properties can be used as adjectives, so that we can talk about &quot;a dark room&quot; (meaning: a room which has the dark property rather than the lighted property). The same goes for the named possibilities for a newly created kind of value:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Colour is a kind of value. The colours are red, blue and green. A building block is a kind of thing. A building block has a colour.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">In the playroom are a red building block and a green building block.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Potentially, at least, &quot;colour&quot; is a widely applicable kind of value, and we already have two different things which have colour. But it often happens that we need adjectives to apply just to a single thing, and if so then a shorthand form is allowed:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The cask is either customs sealed, liable to tax or stolen goods.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Inform deals with this by creating a new kind of value, whose possibilities are the named options supplied, and then giving the named object a property whose value has to be one of the possibilities. Initially the cask will be &quot;customs sealed&quot;, as that was the first value in the list. We could now write, for instance,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The description of the cask is &quot;A well-caulked Spanish wine cask. [if liable to tax]It really is a shame to have to pay duty on it!&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We will often not need to know this, but the kind of value and the property are both automatically given the name of the object with the word &quot;condition&quot; tacked on: so in this case &quot;cask condition&quot;. For instance, we could write:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The printed name of the cask is &quot;wine cask ([cask condition])&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
