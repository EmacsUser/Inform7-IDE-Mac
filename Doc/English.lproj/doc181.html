<p>The final example uses a few features which will not be explained until later chapters, but it shows the kind of &quot;realism&quot; rules which could be introduced using weights. Not entirely realistic: we do not bother to rupture containers out of the player's sight.

<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Lead Cuts Paper&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A weight is a kind of value. 10kg specifies a weight. Everything has a weight. A thing usually has weight 1kg.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A container has a weight called breaking strain. The breaking strain of a container is usually 50kg. Definition: A container is bursting if the total weight of things in it is greater than its breaking strain.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A lead pig, a feather, a silver coin and a paper bag are in a room called the Metallurgy Workshop. The paper bag is a container with breaking strain 2kg.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn when a container (called the sack) held by someone visible (called the chump) is bursting:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The sack] splits and breaks under the weight! [if the player is the chump]You discard[otherwise][The chump] discards[end if] its ruined remains, looking miserably down at [the list of things in the sack] on the floor.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now all of the things in the sack are in the location;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remove the sack from play.
