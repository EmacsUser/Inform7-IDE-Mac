<p>
<p>The special description &quot;doing something&quot; (or &quot;doing anything&quot;) matches any action, and &quot;doing something to ...&quot; or &quot;doing something with ...&quot; also allow an object to be specified.
<p>
<p>For instance, the following puts its object entirely out of bounds:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of doing something to the cucumber sandwich, say &quot;Lady Bracknell stares disapprovingly down her pince-nez at you, in a way which no amount of hunger or curiosity could overcome.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We sometimes need to be a little careful here: &quot;waiting&quot; qualifies as &quot;doing something&quot;, but not as &quot;doing something to something&quot;, because there is no object.
<p>
<p>More often, we would like to restrict the range of allowable actions to a select few. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of doing something other than looking, examining or waiting: say &quot;You must learn patience.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(Or we can write &quot;except&quot; instead of &quot;other than&quot;.) Or we might have an object, too:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of doing something other than examining, taking or dropping with the dagger: say &quot;Don't fool around with that dagger. It's exceedingly sharp.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Note the &quot;with&quot;, which was optional, but makes it clearer that the rule applies only to actions on the dagger.
