<p>Now that we have the time of day, we can of course use this value in room descriptions and the like:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">The Clock Chamber is a room. &quot;The dark chamber behind the clock face, a mill-room of gears which grind down the seconds. Through the glass you can see the reversed hands reading [the time of day].&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>It seems odd, though, to read a precise numerical description of the time here: after all, it isn't a digital clock. A friendlier version would be:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">The Clock Chamber is a room. &quot;The dark chamber behind the clock face, a mill-room of gears which grind down the seconds. Through the glass you can see the reversed hands reading [the time of day in words].&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>And this would produce more natural text such as &quot;... reading twenty to nine&quot; rather than &quot;... reading 8:40 pm&quot;.
<p>
<p>To reiterate an example which came up earlier, we could even work the time of day into the command prompt, which would lend the proper sense of urgency to a game played out against the clock:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">When play begins: change the command prompt to &quot;[time of day] >&quot;.</font></blockquote>
