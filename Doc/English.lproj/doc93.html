<p>In this chapter, all actions have been carried out by the player, all have been drawn from the standard stock of built-in actions (&quot;unlocking&quot;, &quot;taking&quot;, &quot;going&quot; and so forth), and all of those built-in actions have been allowed to work in the standard way - we have seen how to prevent the taking of something, and how to give this unexpected consequences, but not how to make taking work in an entirely different way.
<p>
<p>All three of those restrictions will later be lifted in the chapter on &quot;Advanced Actions&quot;, but otherwise we have covered the ground thoroughly, and it is time to move on to the techniques enabling us to do more than make tart replies to the player: it is time to change the world.
