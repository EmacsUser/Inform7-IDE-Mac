<p>
<p>Inform has a number of special named values to hold the bibliographic data about the work being created - who wrote it, what it is called, what headline it has, what genre it has and what its release number is, and so on.
<p>
<p>These can be set as follows:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The story title is &quot;Mansfield Perk&quot;. The story author is &quot;Janet Austen&quot;. The story headline is &quot;An Interactive Romance&quot;. The story genre is &quot;Romance&quot;. The release number is 7. The story description is &quot;In Miss Austen's new interactive novella, Miss Henrietta Pollifax is adopted by the tempestuous landowner Sir Tankerley Mordant, and must make a new life for herself on the rugged moors.&quot; The story creation year is 2005.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Most of these are self-explanatory. The &quot;story creation year&quot; is provided so that if we need to revise the work to fix some bugs a year later - by no means an uncommon occurrence - then we can make sure it is correctly identified as still being basically a 2005 work. (Just as a book which has had innumerable revised printings may say &quot;First published 1988&quot; on its imprint page.) The &quot;story description&quot; is a piece of text, analogous to the back cover blurb on a book: it might be two or three paragraphs long, so the example above is rather minimal, but it should not be epic in length.
<p>
<p>As we have already seen, a convenient abbreviation provides that if the first sentence of the source text consists solely of text in quotation marks, then that is considered the title. Thus if the source begins:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Mansfield Perk&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>then that will be the &quot;story title&quot;. Further, we can write
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Mansfield Perk&quot; by Janet Austen
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>with the obvious effect: quotation marks around the author's name are optional here, for convenience, but note that we'd better have them in cases like:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Three Men in a Boat&quot; by &quot;Jerome K. Jerome&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>as otherwise the full stop after the K will end the sentence prematurely.
