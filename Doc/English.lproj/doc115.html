<p>Awarding points is only one of the traditional ways which interactive fictions use to signal that progress is being made. Another is to display quotations, as if they were epigraphs, floating over the main text of the game.
<p>
<p>The original example came in <i>Trinity</i>, by Brian Moriarty, in which the player exploring Kensington Gardens comes upon a location enigmatically called The Wabe. By way of explanation, a quotation pops up. The effect can be duplicated in Inform like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After looking in the Wabe, display the boxed quotation
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And 'the wabe' is the grass-plot round
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a sun-dial, I suppose? said Alice,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;surprised at her own ingenuity.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course it is. It's called 'wabe,'
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you know, because it goes a long way
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before it, and a long way behind it --
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Lewis Carroll&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The quotation will only ever appear once, regardless of the number of times the &quot;display the boxed quotation ...&quot; phrase is reached. This is an effect best not overused: <i>Trinity</i> contains only 13 quotations, despite its size and complexity.
