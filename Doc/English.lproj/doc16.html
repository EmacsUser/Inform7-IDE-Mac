<p>Once the source grows beyond 1000 words or so, it can all too easily become disorganised, and by the time it reaches the size of a novella it can be difficult to find things (though the Mac OS X user interface provides a Find function, Command-F, and also a more thorough search panel on the Inspector).
<p>
<p>Inform provides for us to organise the source code in just the way that a printed book would be organised: with headings and subheadings. Firstly, we can put the title at the top. If the first paragraph consists only of a single quoted piece of text, then that's the title; and an author can also be given, as follows:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Spellbreaker&quot; by Dave Lebling
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We will later see that more bibliographic information can also be placed here, in the same way that the imprint page of a novel comes before the text gets going. The author's name can normally be given without quotation marks, so long as it contains no punctuation. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Three Men in a Boat&quot; by &quot;Jerome K. Jerome&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>needs quotes as otherwise the full stop after the K will be mistaken for the end of a sentence.
<p>
<p>A sentence which is the only one in its paragraph and which begins with any of the words &quot;volume&quot;, &quot;book&quot;, &quot;part&quot;, &quot;chapter&quot; or &quot;section&quot; is considered to be a heading or a sub-heading. It must not contain a typed line break, and in order to stand alone in its paragraph there should be a skipped line both before and after it. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Section 2 - Flamsteed's Balloon
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Headings can be written in any format, provided they start with one of the five indicator words, and they are hierarchical: a &quot;Part ...&quot; heading is considered more significant than a &quot;Chapter ...&quot; heading but not so significant as a &quot;Book ...&quot; heading, and so on. (We do not need to use all five kinds of heading.)
