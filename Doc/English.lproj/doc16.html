<p>
<p>It is a cardinal rule that nothing can be in more than one place at the same time, but rules were made to be broken, and an exception is allowed for a special kind of thing called a &quot;backdrop&quot;. For instance:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Streaming&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">The Upper Cave is above the Rock Pool.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">The stream is a backdrop. It is in the Upper Cave and the Rock Pool.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>Backdrops are ordinarily in the background: if the sky needed to be referred to in the course of play, it might be represented by a backdrop, for instance. Here we have a stream of water running through two rooms, though it might be any number. Backdrops are always fixed in place.
<p>
<p>Inform assumes that backdrops are also scenery unless told otherwise: we would not expect to see &quot;You can also see the sky here.&quot; in an outdoor room description. In the case of the stream above, we could artfully mention it in passing in the room descriptions of the Upper Cave and the Rock Pool.
