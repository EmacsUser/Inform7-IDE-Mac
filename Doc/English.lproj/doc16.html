<p>Inform is not comprehensive, nor was meant to be. It actively supports &quot;extensions&quot;, to promote sharing and good practice, and the creation and circulation of extensions is a flourishing part of Inform culture. Why go to great trouble to (say) work out how to make doors open automatically as needed, when somebody else has already perfected this?
<p>
<p>It is probably best for newcomers to steer clear of extensions until they have some practical experience of designing simple works, but there is nothing difficult about using extensions, and a few brief notes are worth giving here. (The final chapter of this manual gives a more comprehensive account, and covers the writing of new extensions.)
<p>
<p>Extensions are identified by name (say &quot;Following People&quot;) and also by author (say &quot;Mary Brown&quot;). They will probably be downloaded from the Internet as needed, or exchanged by email, but they need to be installed before they can be used.
<p>
<p>When using Inform on Mac OS X, this means storing them in the folder
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">~/Library/Inform/Extensions/
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>where &quot;~&quot; signifies your home folder. (This folder will probably need to be created using the Finder.) Each author has a subfolder of this folder, and his or her extensions live inside it. Our example extension should therefore be placed as:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">~/Library/Inform/Extensions/Mary Brown/Following People
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(no filename extension is used). To provide an example, Emily Short's useful extension &quot;Locksmith&quot; comes ready-installed as part of the basic Inform package and need not be downloaded and installed.
