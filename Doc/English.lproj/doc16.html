<p>
<p>We talk about &quot;including&quot; such an extension into a work of IF because the process merges rules and behaviours from the extension with those we have described ourselves. It's not uncommon for contributions by five or six different people to be pooled together this way.
<p>
<p>Including an extension is only a matter of writing a single sentence in the source. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Include Locksmith by Emily Short.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Note that it is compulsory to name both extension and author.
<p>
<p>Many extensions, including this example one, provide their own documentation. To read this, type the above sentence into the source of a project and click Go: then consult the &quot;Contents&quot; section of the Index panel. This will name all of the extensions used and will reveal all of the documentation available on them.
