<p>The player's actions happen not only when he types a command, but can also happen spontaneously as a result of a &quot;try&quot; phrase.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">try going west
<br>try asking Will to try going west
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The latter might, of course, result in Will trying going west: or it might not - that depends on the persuasion rules. But as the author, we have the ultimate powers of persuasion, and can make Will act in any way we like, without asking:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">try Will trying going west
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Nobody in the simulated world requested this: it is an impulse felt by Will alone, so that - from the player's point of view - Will is acting spontaneously. The player need not be anywhere nearby, and may never know what happened. Recall that when actions work their way down through the flow-chart, they are stopped before reaching the &quot;report&quot; stage - when the player is told about them - if they are running &quot;silently&quot;. This is also where Inform stops an action which is not witnessed by the player.
<p>
<p><hr><img border=0 src=beta.png>Inform does not (yet) support &quot;try Will asking Elanor to try going west&quot;, but we hope to add actions of the form eventually.
