Giving instructions</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Actions&quot; are what we get if we try to break down a narrative into its irreducible parts. We might casually say that we are &quot;going shopping&quot;, but this involves many smaller steps: going north, going east, entering the shop, examining a loaf of bread, taking it, giving money to the baker, and so on. In order to make interesting events happen in the course of an interactive version of this story, we might need to write instructions laying out what to do in response to any of these actions. So we must first cover the giving of instructions.
<p>
<p>For instance, here is a different sort of sentence to any seen so far:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When play begins: say &quot;Welcome to Old Marston Grange, a country house cut off by fog.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This is not a passive statement of facts (&quot;The Library is a room&quot;) but takes the form of an instruction to someone: that person is the computer, acting as our agent in talking with the player. It is an example of a &quot;rule&quot;, the analogy being with the rules written inside the box-lid of an old board game, rather than rules in the scientific sense.
<p>
<p>The sentence opens by identifying the circumstances in which the rule applies, leading up to the colon, and then gives a list of things to do, divided by semicolons except that the last ends with a full stop. In this case it's a list which has only one step to follow, but rules vary in length up to hundreds of steps.
<p>
<p>There's nothing to stop us laying this out as a vertical list, if we prefer:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When play begins:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Welcome to Old Marston Grange, a country house cut off by fog.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
