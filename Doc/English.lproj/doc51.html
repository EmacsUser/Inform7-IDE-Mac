<p>
<p>It is in describing circumstances that Inform really capitalises on the concise, expressive power of natural language, and this brief chapter brings together the facts about &quot;descriptions&quot;: phrases which refer to things.
<p>
<p>The simplest descriptions consist of a noun alone. Some refer to single things (&quot;lantern&quot;, or &quot;wine cask&quot;), others to kinds of thing (&quot;dead end&quot; or &quot;container&quot;). But we have also seen adjectives alone:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The oaken desk is fixed in place.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Here, &quot;fixed in place&quot; is a description which, to Inform's simple-minded grammar, is a single adjective. And of course adjectives and nouns can be combined:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The cargo trunk is an openable container.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The description &quot;openable container&quot; consists of the noun &quot;container&quot;, meaning a kind of thing, and the adjective &quot;openable&quot;, which means one of the two possible states of an either/or property held by that thing.
<p>
<p>Sentences like these are only one venue for descriptions, and the next chapter will have much greater need of them:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of throwing something at a closed openable door, say &quot;Or you could just use the handle like anyone else, of course.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Here &quot;something&quot; and &quot;a closed openable door&quot; are both descriptions.
