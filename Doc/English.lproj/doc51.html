<p>Two further elaborations of action descriptions increase the range of possibilities further.
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of eating something in the presence of Lady Bracknell, say &quot;Lady Bracknell disapproves thoroughly of gentlemen who snack between meals, and there are few disapprovals in this world quite so thorough as Lady Bracknell's.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>As might be guessed, this applies when the action takes place in the same location as the person named: and of course that person can also be described more vaguely (&quot;... in the presence of a woman&quot;, say), and can just as easily be an inanimate thing (&quot;... in the presence of the radio set&quot;).
<p>
<p>The last of these optional clauses we can tack on to the description of an action is the most general of all. We can add &quot;when&quot; and then any condition at all, as in:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of eating something when the radio set is switched on, say &quot;Something about the howling short-wave static puts you right off luncheon.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>As something of an afterthought, it is occasionally useful to use &quot;not&quot; when describing actions, even though it does make some curious-looking sentences:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of not waiting, say &quot;Be patient.&quot;</font></blockquote>
