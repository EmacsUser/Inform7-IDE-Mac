<p>
<p>Although it is only useful to a limited extent, we can make any number of copies of something:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('&quot;Polygons&quot;\n\nA shape is a kind of thing. A square is a kind of shape. A triangle is a kind of shape.\n\nThe Geometry Lab is a room. In the Geometry Lab are three triangles and two squares.\n\n\n')"><img border=0 src=paste.png></a> &quot;Polygons&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A shape is a kind of thing. A square is a kind of shape. A triangle is a kind of shape.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Geometry Lab is a room. In the Geometry Lab are three triangles and two squares.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The description &quot;three triangles&quot; makes three identical things, each of the kind &quot;triangle&quot;, and similarly for the squares. When the above is compiled, the player can type &quot;take two triangles&quot; or &quot;take all the triangles&quot; and so forth.
<p>
<p>Two caveats. Firstly, a counted-out description like &quot;two squares&quot; is only allowed if it combines a number with the name of a kind which is already known (perhaps modified with adjectives, so &quot;two open doors&quot; is fine). If we say:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Two circles are in the Lab.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>without having defined &quot;circle&quot; as a kind in advance, then only a single object will be created - whose name is &quot;two circles&quot;. (This is because many natural names start with numbers: &quot;six of clubs&quot;, for instance, referring to a single playing card, or &quot;12 Hollywood Close&quot; meaning a single house. We wouldn't want such names to be misinterpreted.)
<p>
<p>The second caveat is that excessive duplication is expensive in memory and running time. It is perfectly legal to say
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">In the Lab are 75 triangles.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>but the resulting game may be a little sluggish: and Inform draws the line at 100, refusing to create more duplicates than that in any single place. If we really need more than about fifty duplicated objects - say, a tombola containing raffle tickets numbered 1 to 1000 - it is usually better to find some less literal way to simulate this: for instance, only having a single raffle ticket, but with a randomly chosen number on it.

<table border=0 bgcolor="#e0e0e0" width=100%><tr><td><font face="lucida grande,geneva,arial,tahoma,verdana,helvetica,helv" size=2><a name="e11"><a href=doc48.html#e11><img border=0 src=../FlipOpen.png></a> <font color="#800000"><b>Example</b> (***).</font> <i>A child's set of building blocks, which come in three different colours - red, green and blue - but which can be repainted during play.</i><p>
<p>
<p>This would be a one-star example if it were not for the repainting:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('A building block is a kind of thing. A red block, a blue block and a green block are kinds of building block.\n\nThe Nursery is a room. In the Nursery are six red blocks, four blue blocks and a green block.\n\n\n')"><img border=0 src=paste.png></a> A building block is a kind of thing. A red block, a blue block and a green block are kinds of building block.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Nursery is a room. In the Nursery are six red blocks, four blue blocks and a green block.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>But a kind cannot change during play, so this will not do. Instead, the colour will have to be a property of the block. So we might first try this:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('Colour is a kind of value. The colours are red, blue and green. A block is a kind of thing. A block is usually blue. A block has a colour.\n\nThe Nursery is a room. In the Nursery are six red blocks, four blue blocks and a green block.\n\n\n')"><img border=0 src=paste.png></a> Colour is a kind of value. The colours are red, blue and green. A block is a kind of thing. A block is usually blue. A block has a colour.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Nursery is a room. In the Nursery are six red blocks, four blue blocks and a green block.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Which is fine, so far as it goes, but the colour property is not at all visible to the player, who simply sees &quot;eleven blocks&quot;. We thought of colour as being something outwardly apparent, but Inform does not know this. To achieve a better effect, we will need features from distant chapters. The first is an activity called &quot;printing the name of&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('Colour is a kind of value. The colours are red, blue and green. A block is a kind of thing. A block is usually blue. A block has a colour. Before printing the name of a block: say &quot;[colour] &quot;.\n\n\n')"><img border=0 src=paste.png></a> Colour is a kind of value. The colours are red, blue and green. A block is a kind of thing. A block is usually blue. A block has a colour. Before printing the name of a block: say &quot;[colour] &quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This too, however, is unsatisfactory. The individual blocks are correctly described, but we are unable to distinguish them during play: we cannot type &quot;take a green block&quot;, for instance. And because the blocks are indistinguishable in play, they are still massed together as &quot;eleven blocks&quot; in room descriptions. We need to go one step further:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('Colour is a kind of value. The colours are red, blue and green. A block is a kind of thing. A block is usually blue. A block has a colour. Before printing the name of a block: say &quot;[colour] &quot;. Understand the colour property as describing a block.\n\n\n')"><img border=0 src=paste.png></a> Colour is a kind of value. The colours are red, blue and green. A block is a kind of thing. A block is usually blue. A block has a colour. Before printing the name of a block: say &quot;[colour] &quot;. Understand the colour property as describing a block.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And now everything works nicely: the blocks are grouped by colour, and can be referred to by colour, and we can even change the colour of an individual block during play.
