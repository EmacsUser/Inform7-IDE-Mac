<p>We have already seen, in the chapter on Descriptions which is a forerunner of this one, that Inform provides not only &quot;adjacent&quot; as a way of seeing if one room is directly connected to another, but also &quot;the best route from A to B&quot;, which allows us to see if any sequence of moves connects them.
<p>
<p>Something similar - in fact, simpler - is allowed for any relation. Suppose we would like to go sledging: we can go downhill, but not up. Some quite distant places may be reachable, while others close by may not be, even if lower than us, because they would involve climbing again at some point. The following would implement this:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('Overlooking relates various rooms to various rooms.\n\nThe verb to overlook (it overlooks, they overlook, it overlooked, it is overlooked, it is overlooking) implies the overlooking relation.\n\nThe Garden overlooks the Shrubbery. The Folly overlooks the Garden. The Shrubbery overlooks the Sundial Plot. The Old Ice House overlooks the Garden.\n\nAfter looking:\n\tsay &quot;This wintry vantage point overlooks [the list of rooms overlooked by the location].&quot;;\n\tlet the way be the next step via the overlooking relation from the location to the Sundial Plot;\n\tif the way is a room, say &quot;To sledge downhill to the Sundial, aim for [the way].&quot;;\n\totherwise say &quot;It is not possible to sledge downhill to the Sundial.&quot;\n\n\n')"><img border=0 src=paste.png></a> Overlooking relates various rooms to various rooms.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The verb to overlook (it overlooks, they overlook, it overlooked, it is overlooked, it is overlooking) implies the overlooking relation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Garden overlooks the Shrubbery. The Folly overlooks the Garden. The Shrubbery overlooks the Sundial Plot. The Old Ice House overlooks the Garden.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After looking:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;This wintry vantage point overlooks [the list of rooms overlooked by the location].&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let the way be the next step via the overlooking relation from the location to the Sundial Plot;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the way is a room, say &quot;To sledge downhill to the Sundial, aim for [the way].&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;It is not possible to sledge downhill to the Sundial.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Another example would be the &quot;six degrees of separation&quot; game, where it is claimed that any two people on Earth are connected by a sequence of up to six acquaintances. In an Inform implementation, we might talk about &quot;the next step via the friendship relation from George Bush to Saddam Hussein&quot;, for instance, a phrase likely to evaluate to Donald Rumsfeld, and then
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">the number of steps via the friendship relation from George Bush to Saddam Hussein
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>would be... but that would be telling. We can calculate the number of steps like this for any relation: it works exactly analogously to &quot;the number of moves from A to B&quot;, which reads the map. The same conventions apply: the result is 0 if the two things are the same, and -1 if there is no way to get from one to the other.

<p>
<p>Suppose that we have a core set of issues we want to be able to bring up with all the characters, and we want characters to draw intelligent connections between different conversation topics. We will need some model of how things relate to one another, so:
<p>

</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>For that matter, we could use the same system to have characters make sense of any physical evidence the character shows them:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of showing something which suggests the current subject to someone:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The second noun] nods impatiently.&quot;

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try asking the second noun about the subject the next subject;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The second noun] shrugs.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if.

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When play begins:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;change the left hand status line to &quot;Discussing: [current subject]&quot;;

<p>

<p>
<p>Now we can define what gets said when the subject is changed, regardless of whether the segue was introduced in speech or by a shown object. Since rows are blanked after use, the speaker will never repeat herself; if we provide more than one line about the same pair of topics, the first one will be used, then the second, and so on, until the table runs out:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To relate (initial - a subject) with (next - a subject):

</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>If we had more than one character in the scenario, we could provide multiple tables, but this will do to demonstrate the idea.
<p>
<p>Of course, we can override specific instances, if we want the character always to say the same thing regardless of how we came to this point:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of asking Lady Uckfield about the subject penmanship:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;change the current subject to penmanship;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;She sighs. 'So few people write really beautifully these days.'&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We would have to be careful about this system, since we have applied a various-to-various relation to every single object in the game. In practice it would probably be wisest to restrict it a bit, with judicious definitions of kind and so on.
