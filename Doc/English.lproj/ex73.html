<p>
<p>In every example so far, and in almost all practical cases, the first word in a command which results in an action will be something fixed: a verb, in fact. When we write
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;photograph [something]&quot; as photographing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>we are saying that the first word of such a command will always be &quot;photograph&quot;. Occasionally, though, we would like to understand a noun as a command, perhaps in a situation where the command is obvious. If we say:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;[something]&quot; as examining.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>then the command &quot;examine&quot; will be implicit when the player types a bare noun:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A red box and a blue ball are here.
<br>> ball
<br>The blue ball is plaited from many small leather patches.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>so that the command &quot;ball&quot; has resulted in the action &quot;examining the blue ball&quot;.
<p>
<p>This is a feature which should be used sparingly, since it could easily lead to confusion if not carefully explained to the player. By default, it is not used at all.

<p>
<p>The foregoing example moves the player one location towards his destination, and requires that rooms have been visited before. But suppose we wanted to be a bit more lenient about movement, and let the player make as many steps as necessary per turn.

<p>Notice that we continue the movement until one of two things happens: either the player reaches the room that is his destination, or the going attempt doesn't work. In the latter case we stop the action in order to avoid hanging the game up in a loop. This event might occur when the player runs into a locked door, for instance.
<p>
<p>We might also want him to automatically open and unlock any doors he encounters on the way; to this end we can just include the lock-handling extension. Now every time the code attempts opening a door, unlocking rules will also be invoked.
