<p>
<p>A description can not only talk about things in terms of themselves, but also in terms of their relationships to the rest of the world. For instance,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">an open container on the table
<br>a woman inside a lighted room
<br>an animal carried by a man
<br>a woman taller than Mark
<br>something worn by somebody
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>are all valid descriptions. These are really abbreviations, having missed out the words &quot;which is&quot; or &quot;who is&quot;, as appropriate:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">an open container which is on the table
<br>a woman who is inside a lighted room
<br>an animal which is carried by a man
<br>a woman who is taller than Mark
<br>something which is worn by somebody
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>and indeed those are also valid descriptions. The other sentence verbs can all be used here, too. So for instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">a man who does not wear anything
<br>something which supports something
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And sometimes we should spell out &quot;who is&quot; regardless:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">a man who is not Sherlock Holmes
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Since these clauses can be attached to the end of any valid description, descriptions can grow longer still:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">something worn by a woman who is in a dark room
</font></blockquote><p>
