<p>Inform's lexicon is not just a figure of speech: Inform actually does maintain an alphabetical list of nouns and adjectives which can be used in descriptions, and that lexicon can be browsed in a project's Index.
<p>
<p>To summarise. Nouns are straightforward: they refer to specific things (&quot;wine cask&quot;) or specific kinds (even &quot;something&quot;, which refers to &quot;thing&quot;). Adjectives, however, come from three possible sources:
<p>
<p>(a) From either/or properties. For instance, &quot;open&quot; and &quot;closed&quot;, which are antonyms: what is not open is closed, and vice versa.
<p>
<p>(b) When we create a new kind of value, and allow it to be a property of a given kind, we also create new adjectives:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Colour is a kind of value. The colours are red, blue and green. A building block is a kind of thing. A building block has a colour.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We can now use the adjective &quot;green&quot; (for instance) in descriptions:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of taking a green building block, say &quot;For some reason you have an aversion to the colour green.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And similarly when we use the more convenient form for single things, such as the cask in this example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The cask is either customs sealed, liable to tax or stolen goods.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(c) From direct definitions, such as the adjective &quot;occupied&quot; created by:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: a supporter is occupied if something is on it.
</font></blockquote><p>
