<p>
<p>Properties depend very much on kind. It makes no sense to ask whether a room is transparent or opaque, for instance, so Inform will not allow this either to be specified or queried.
<p>
<p>Another way that kind influences properties can be seen from an earlier example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Gazebo is a room. A billiards table is in the Gazebo. On it is a trophy cup. A starting pistol is in the cup.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The cup, the pistol and the table are all allowed to have the &quot;fixed in place&quot; property, but in fact only the table actually has it: the cup and the pistol are created as &quot;portable&quot; instead. This is because Inform knows that most things are portable, but that supporters - such as the table - are usually fixed in place. If this assumption is wrong, we need only add the line:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The table is portable.
</font></blockquote><p>
