<p>
<p>A variable, as we have seen, is a name for a value which changes, though always remaining of the same kind. For instance, if &quot;target&quot; is a number variable (or &quot;number that varies&quot;) then it may change value from 2 to 4, but not from 2 to &quot;fishknife&quot;.
<p>
<p>To make complicated decisions, phrases often need to remember values on a temporary basis. We have already seen this for the counter in a &quot;repeat&quot; loop, which exists only inside that loop, and then is no longer needed. Now we define named values which exist only inside the current phrase. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">let outer bull be 25;
<br>let the current appearance be &quot;reddish brown&quot;;
<br>let the special room be Marley Wood;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>creates temporary variables &quot;outer bull&quot;, &quot;current appearance&quot; and &quot;special room&quot;. The kinds of these are deduced from the values given, so that, for instance,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">say &quot;The outer bull scores [the outer bull in words] when you practice archery in [special room].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>produces
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The outer bull scores twenty-five when you practice archery in Marley Wood.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Temporary variables made by &quot;let&quot; are only temporarily in existence while a phrase is being carried out. Their values often change: we could say
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">let x be 10;
<br>change x to 11;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>for instance, or indeed we could &quot;let x be 10&quot; and then &quot;let x be 11&quot;. But although we are allowed to change the value, we are not allowed to change the kind of value. The name &quot;x&quot; must always have the same kind of value throughout the phrase to which it belongs, so the following will not be allowed:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">let x be 45;
<br>change x to &quot;Norway&quot;;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(The difference between &quot;let&quot; and &quot;change&quot; is that &quot;let&quot; can create a new temporary variable, whereas &quot;change&quot; can only alter one which already exists: on the other hand, &quot;change&quot; can change many other things as well, whereas &quot;let&quot; applies only to temporary variables.)
