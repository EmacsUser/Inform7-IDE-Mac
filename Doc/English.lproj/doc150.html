<p>
<p>The phrases described in this documentation, such as &quot;say...&quot; or &quot;start the player at...&quot;, are all defined in the Standard Rules, and are for the most part defined not in terms of other I7 phrases but instead reduced to equivalents in I6. For instance:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">To end the game in death: (- deadflag=1; -).</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>The notation &quot;(-&quot; and &quot;-)&quot; indicates that what comes in between is I6 code. The minus sign is supposed to be a mnemonic for the decrease from 7 to 6: later we shall use &quot;(+&quot; and &quot;+)&quot; to go back up the other way, from 6 to 7.
<p>
<p>When a phrase is defined as containing only a single command, and that command is defined using I6 - as here - it is compiled in-line. This means that the phrase &quot;end the game in death&quot; will always be translated as &quot;deadflag=1;&quot;, rather than being translated into a call to a suitable function whose only statement is &quot;deadflag=1;&quot;.
<p>
<p>This is an easy case since the wording never varies. A more typical example would be:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">To say the (something - number): (- print {something}; -).</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>Where the &quot;{something}&quot; appears, the appropriate I7 code is compiled to a suitable I6 expression. So, for instance,
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">say the capacity of the table</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>might become
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">print O17_table.capacity;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>Braces &quot;{&quot; are of course significant in I6. A real brace can be obtained by making the character following it a space, and then I7 will not attempt to read it as a request for substitution.
