<p>
<p>Inform keeps track of the time of day automatically: play ordinarily begins at 9 AM and each turn takes one minute. In some works of interactive fiction, time of day is crucial: in others, it is irrelevant or even, by a sort of tacit convention, non-existent. So Inform does nothing to act upon the time, or to reveal it to the player, without instruction. Nevertheless it is there.
<p>
<p>A sentence like the following will change the initial time from 9 AM to whatever is preferred:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">The time of day is 3:13 PM.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>Here, &quot;3:13 PM&quot; is a constant value of a kind not seen before: it's a kind of value called &quot;time&quot;, and the value &quot;time of day&quot; is a time that varies. After one turn it will be 3:14 PM, then 3:15 PM and so on. We can of course use this value in room descriptions and the like:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">The Clock Chamber is a room. &quot;The dark chamber behind the clock face, a mill-room of gears which grind down the seconds. Through the glass you can see the reversed hands reading [the time of day].&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>It seems odd, though, to read a precise numerical description of the time here: after all, it isn't a digital clock. A friendlier version would be:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">The Clock Chamber is a room. &quot;The dark chamber behind the clock face, a mill-room of gears which grind down the seconds. Through the glass you can see the reversed hands reading [the time of day in words].&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>And this would produce more natural text such as &quot;... reading twenty to nine&quot; rather than &quot;... reading 8:40 pm&quot;.
