<p>
<p>Properties can only be given to something if its kind will permit that: we cannot make a chair &quot;dark&quot; or a room &quot;portable&quot;, for instance. When creating kinds, then, we need a way to specify the properties which that kind of thing will allow, and this will need to include new properties of our own devising.
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">A dead end can be secret or ordinary.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>
<p>This creates just one new property, not two, as the names are taken as the two states of a single either/or property: secret means not ordinary, ordinary means not secret. Alternatively, we could just say:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">A dead end can be secret.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>in which case the opposite of &quot;secret&quot; would be &quot;not secret&quot;.
<p>
<p>Note that we are free to add to the definitions of kinds which already exist, not just those we have created ourselves: for instance,
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">A room can be indoors or outdoors.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>
<p>creates a new property which all rooms either possess or don't. And so on. If we make the above definitions then by default, any dead ends created will be &quot;ordinary&quot; and any rooms created will be &quot;outdoors&quot;: that is, in the absence of other information it is assumed that a new either/or property will not be held. We could reverse this behaviour by adding:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">A dead end is usually secret. A room is usually indoors.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>So much for either/or properties. Moving on to properties which contain values, such as the &quot;matching key&quot; property of a door or a container, we need to use a different formulation.
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">A dead end has a property called river sound. The river sound of a dead end is usually &quot;a faint whispering of running water&quot;. The Tortuous Alcove has river sound &quot;a gurgle of running water&quot;.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>The property &quot;river sound&quot; is now applicable only to dead ends, and we would not be allowed to talk about it in any other context. As can be seen, it holds a piece of text. If we tried the following:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">The river sound of the Tortuous Alcove is 7.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>...then Inform would object, because the number 7 is the wrong kind of value to go into the &quot;river sound&quot; property. If we need a numerical property, we can try this instead:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">A dead end has a number called the difficulty rating. The Tortuous Alcove has difficulty rating 7.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>(When we say &quot;has a property called...&quot; we implicitly allow it to hold either text or the name of a room or object, since it is often convenient to be able to store both interchangeably in the same property.)
