<p>
<p>Everything has one and only one kind: but kinds can have more specific kinds. Inform makes the world out of three fundamental kinds of object, &quot;room&quot;, &quot;thing&quot; and &quot;direction&quot;: browsing the Kinds index will give an idea of how the others fit together. A container, for instance, is a kind of thing.
<p>
<p>Any new kind must be created as a special case of an existing one. Here we sub-categorise rooms:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">A dead end is a kind of room.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>Any dead end that we make is also a room, but can also have other properties in addition, if we so decide. For the purposes of this example, it's useful to mention a property not seen so far: rooms can be &quot;dark&quot; or &quot;lighted&quot;, all the examples so far having been lighted. Similarly, a thing with the property of being a &quot;light source&quot; will enable the player to see inside dark rooms, and to carry out other activities requiring light, such as examining items.
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">A dead end is a kind of room with printed name &quot;Dead End&quot; and description &quot;This is a dead end. You'll have to go back the way you came.&quot; A dead end is usually dark.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">The Undertomb is a dark room. East is a dead end. South is a dead end with printed name &quot;Collapsed Dead End&quot;. Northwest is a dead end called the Tortuous Alcove.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">In the Undertomb is the candle lantern. It is a light source.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>Three different rooms adjoin the Undertomb as a result. Notice how much more concise this is thanks to having the &quot;dead end&quot; kind to hand.
<p>
<p>What is a kind, really? In the end it is a name for a bundle of properties, and the key differences between a kind (such as &quot;container&quot;) and a property (such as &quot;fixed in place&quot;) are that, firstly, something only has one kind (except in the sense that a container is also a thing, and so on), and secondly, it has that kind forever, whereas properties may change.
