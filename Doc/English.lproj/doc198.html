<p>Extensions often need to define kinds, which we want to make as helpful as possible for the user. In particular, we want to make new instances of those kinds easy to create. An interesting example of this came up in Chapter 2, when clothing was introduced. For something to be a fully practical garment, worn by the player when play begins, it needs to be &quot;worn&quot;, &quot;wearable&quot; and &quot;initially carried&quot;: if the source forgets to specify the latter two properties, the results are mysterious and unfortunate.
<p>
<p>The Standard Rules solve this problem by including the following line:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Something worn is usually wearable and initially carried.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Such a sentence is called an &quot;implication&quot;, as it is in the form &quot;Condition A implies Condition B&quot;. Inform never overrides certainties with mere implications, and is cautious about allowing them to build overly long chains of argument. This is to prevent the following kind of difficulty:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">An open door is usually closed. A closed door is usually open.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Implications have not been mentioned up to now since they are only really needed by extensions, but also because they can be tricky, with unforeseen consequences. Handle with care.
