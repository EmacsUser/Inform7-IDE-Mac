<p><i>What goes wrong:</i>
<p>
<p>
<p>I was expecting any of a number of possibilities from Problems to run-time errors, but what I got instead was just
<p>
<p>Les Remparts
<p>
<p>>dine
<p>>i
<p>You are carrying:
<p>  a spoon
<p>  a bowl of soup
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p><i>Comments:</i>
<p>
<p>
<p>I realize there are good reasons this doesn't work, and it just needs a problem message or something to warn off the overambitious.
