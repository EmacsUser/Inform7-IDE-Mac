<p>
<p>Inform has four special named values to hold the bibliographic data about the work being created - who wrote it, what it is called, what genre it has and what its release number is.
<p>
<p>These can be set as follows:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">The story title is &quot;Mansfield Perk&quot;. The story author is &quot;Janet Austen&quot;. The story genre is &quot;An Interactive Romance&quot;. The release number is 7.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>A convenient abbreviation provides that if the first sentence of the source text consists solely of text in quotation marks, then that is considered the title. Thus if the source begins:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Mansfield Perk&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>then that will be the story title. Further, we can write
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Mansfield Perk&quot; by Janet Austen</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>with the obvious effect: quotation marks around the author's name are optional here, for convenience, but note that we'd better have them in cases like:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Three Men in a Boat&quot; by &quot;Jerome K. Jerome&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>as otherwise the full stop after the K will end the sentence prematurely.
<p>
<p>If unspecified, the story genre is &quot;An Interactive Fiction&quot;, in accordance with tradition, and the release number is 1.
