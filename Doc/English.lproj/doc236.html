<p>The activity &quot;printing the name of something&quot; is the process of printing up the name of something on screen: ordinarily, this means saying the text in its &quot;printed name&quot; property.
<p>
<p>As with actions, rules can be attached to activities which change or augment what would normally happen. In fact the situation is simpler, because (unlike an action) an activity always finishes, so there is no question of not reaching its &quot;after&quot; stage. There are also only three rulebooks attached to an activity, as compared with the six affecting an action.
<p>
<p>The three rulebooks for printing the name are called &quot;before printing the name&quot;, &quot;for printing the name&quot; and &quot;after printing the name&quot;, and this is the general pattern. What happens is:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">1. All &quot;before printing the name of&quot; rules are considered;
<br>2. The most specific, applicable &quot;rule for printing the name of&quot; is considered;
<br>3. All &quot;after printing the name of&quot; rules are considered.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The actual task is carried out by one single rule tucked into the back of the &quot;for...&quot; rulebook: it is the rule for printing the name of whatever is concerned, hence the name. Inform's standard activities are all of this pattern: they start out with no &quot;before&quot; or &quot;after&quot; rules, and just one &quot;for&quot; rule.
