<p>Activities tend to be about process, rather than outcome. Many of the things Inform does - printing up lists of items, reading commands from the keyboard, and so on - are done as activities, because that way the process can be nudged a little. Too many works of interactive fiction betray their mechanical nature by making it visible that the general machinery being used does not quite seem natural for this or that situation. Activities enable us to add the many graceful touches which avoid that: which contribute nothing to a work, and also everything.
<p>
<p>The rest of this chapter covers every activity in the standard rules, with one section for each. Reading once through will give a sense of the possibilities, but it is intended primarily for reference, because nobody would remember the names and circumstances for all of these things without looking them up.
