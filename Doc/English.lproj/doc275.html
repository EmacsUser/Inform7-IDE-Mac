<p>Accompanying files are not the only things which can be included in a &quot;release along with&quot; sentence:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Release along with cover art, a file of &quot;Collegio magazine&quot; called &quot;Collegio.pdf&quot; and a file of &quot;The mating call of the green wyvern&quot; called &quot;Mating Wyverns.mp3&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Cover art for a work should be prepared in either JPEG (&quot;.jpg&quot;) or PNG (&quot;.png&quot;) format, and we recommend that it should be square, like a music album cover. Programs which notice the cover art for a work of IF are likely to scale this up or down as convenient for their own display purposes, but it would be helpful to provide the original art at 960 by 960 resolution. (Remember, it is intended for use on screen, so providing art at magazine full-page print quality will add nothing and will only make the resulting release an annoyingly large download: even as it is, 960x960 will print out as a pretty respectable CD insert sleeve.)
<p>
<p>If we are providing cover art, or asking Inform to construct a website, then we need to collate the materials in a suitable folder. Suppose that our project is called &quot;Magician.inform&quot;, a project file which happens to be placed in the folder &quot;Works in Progress&quot;. Then we should set up the following arrangement:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Works in Progress
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magician Materials
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collegio.pdf
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cover.jpg
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mating Wyverns.mp3
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small Cover.jpg
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magician.inform
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(supposing that, as in the previous examples, &quot;Collegio.pdf&quot; and &quot;Mating Wyverns.mp3&quot; are the filenames of two feelies that accompany the release). &quot;Small Cover.jpg&quot; should be a reduction of the main cover art image &quot;Cover.jpg&quot; to exactly 120 by 120 pixels.
