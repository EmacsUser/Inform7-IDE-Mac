<p>The map of an interactive fiction is the layout of rooms and the entrances and exits which connect them. So far, these map connections have always run from one room to another, like so:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">The Painted Room is north of the Undertomb.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>However, we can also interpose doors between rooms, like so:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">The red rock stair is east of the Orchard and above the Undertomb. The stair is an open door.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>The second sentence is needed since otherwise Inform will take &quot;red rock stair&quot; to be the name of a third room, whereas what we want is for the stair to be something physically present in both the Orchard and in the Undertomb, and acting as a conduit between them. To this end it needs to be a &quot;door&quot;, a kind we have not so far seen. In the absence of any other instruction, a newly created door will be fixed in place, closed and openable. Fixed in place is certainly right here, but not closed, which is why we specified that it should be &quot;open&quot;.
<p>
<p>In real life, most doors are two-sided, and can be used from either of the rooms which they join, but this is not always convenient for interactive fiction. Here is a one-sided door:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">The blue door is a door. It is south of Notting Hill. Through it is the Flat Landing.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>(Note the use of &quot;it&quot; here as an optional abbreviation.) This will make a door visible only on the Notting Hill side; no map connection will be made in the reverse direction, unless we ask for one.
