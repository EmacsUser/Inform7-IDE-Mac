<p>
<p>One more preliminary. Inform has a small number of optional settings which affect the result of translating the source. The sentence:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Use American dialect.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>makes the resulting work of IF use American spellings (except where the designer spells otherwise) and the American convention for spelling out numbers (thus, &quot;one hundred seventeen&quot; not &quot;one hundred and seventeen&quot;). Similarly:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Use the serial comma.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>uses a comma when printing lists: thus &quot;Julian, Dick, George, and Anne&quot; rather than &quot;Julian, Dick, George and Anne&quot;. A more profound change is made by
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Use no scoring.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>which abolishes the concept of a numerical score - something which modern authors of interactive fiction often feel is inappropriate, but which Inform does provide by default. Two alternative options:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Use full-length room descriptions.
<br>Use abbreviated room descriptions.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>change the normal way room descriptions are shown: normally they are given in full when the room is first entered, but are subsequently shortened unless the player actually asks to &quot;look&quot;. In full-length mode, they are always given in full; in abbreviated mode, never. (The latter is a bad idea in any publically released game, but is provided for completeness and in case it may help testing.)
<p>
<p>Lastly, for the benefit of Inform 6 users or for projects which overflow Inform 6's normal limits, we can specify settings like:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Use MAX_ZCODE_SIZE of 60000.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(or any of I6's other memory settings): the effect is to raise the setting if need be, but never to lower it.
<p>
<p>We can combine any number of options in a single &quot;Use&quot; sentence, so for example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Use American dialect and the serial comma.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>brings about both of these changes.
