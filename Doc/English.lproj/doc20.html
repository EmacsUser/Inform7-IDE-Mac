<p>
<p>A &quot;device&quot; is another of the standard kinds of thing, and should be used for anything which can be switched on or off: a light switch, say, or a slide projector. Devices are generally machines, clockwork or electrical. A device is always either &quot;switched on&quot; or &quot;switched off&quot;, but is switched off unless we specify otherwise.
<p>
<p>That makes three kinds of thing which will likely change their appearance according to which of their two possible states they are in: doors and containers, which can be open or closed; and devices, which can be switched on or switched off. We can provide for this with:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">In the Undertomb is an openable container called the coffin. The coffin has description when open &quot;The lid of a plank coffin yawns open.&quot; The coffin has description when closed &quot;A plank coffin lies upon the dirt floor of the Tomb.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>Containers and doors have the &quot;description when open&quot; and &quot;description when closed&quot; properties, whereas devices have the similar &quot;description when on&quot; and &quot;description when off&quot; properties.
