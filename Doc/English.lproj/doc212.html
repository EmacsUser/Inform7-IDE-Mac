<p>Or we might want to suspend other laws of nature, as in the following example, which is due to Emily Short:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Access All Areas&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The extremely difficult door is north of the Standing Room and south of the Room of Walking Upside Down.  It is a locked door.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The player is carrying the Pointy Hat of Liminal Transgression. The hat is wearable.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A procedural rule: if the Hat is worn, ignore the can't go through closed doors rule.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(The Pointy Hat may be useful in debugging a game, even if it never makes it into the final published work.)
<p>
<p>The &quot;can't go through closed doors rule&quot; is one of those belonging to the &quot;check going&quot; rulebook. These names are fairly explanatory when written out, but hard to remember: fortunately we don't need to remember them, as the Index panel contains a full inventory of the check, carry out and report rules for every action, showing all of their names and the order in which they are checked.
