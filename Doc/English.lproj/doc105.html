<p>We have seen that while rooms are fixed, their contents move around, so we will need ways to examine the current whereabouts of things. The following examples show the kind of conditions allowed:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the genie's lamp <b>is in</b> Aladdin's Cave ...
<br>if Aladdin <b>is not in</b> Aladdin's Cave ...
<br>if Aladdin's Cave <b>contains</b> the genie's lamp ...
<br>if the genie's lamp <b>is carried by</b> Aladdin ...
<br>if Aladdin <b>is carrying</b> the genie's lamp ...
<br>if the genie's lamp <b>is carried by</b> Aladdin ...
<br>if Aladdin <b>does not have</b> the genie's lamp ...
<br>if the table <b>supports</b> the genie's lamp ...
<br>if the table <b>is supporting</b> the genie's lamp ...
<br>if the genie's lamp <b>is supported by</b> the table ...
<br>if the genie's lamp <b>is on</b> the table ...
<br>if the genie's lamp <b>is on top of</b> the table ...
<br>if the genie's lamp <b>is in</b> the cupboard ...
<br>if the genie's lamp <b>is contained in</b> the cupboard ...
<br>if the genie's lamp <b>is inside</b> the cupboard ...
<br>if the genie's lamp <b>is within</b> the cupboard ...
</font></blockquote><p>

<p>As then previous section mentioned, these are exactly like the assertions which we use to set up the world, except that we make them questions by placing &quot;if&quot; in front. But we shall later see that we can also use three other tenses, not to mention plural forms, so that new verbal forms like &quot;had not been inside&quot; and &quot;were not supported by&quot; are legal here (which they would not be in assertions). What we are not allowed is to contract these verbs with apostrophes: &quot;isn't&quot;, &quot;hasn't&quot; and &quot;hadn't&quot; are forbidden.
<p>
<p>Overwhelmingly the condition we check most is whether the player is carrying something. The following are therefore equivalent:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the genie's lamp is carried by the player ...
<br>if the genie's lamp is carried ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And similarly for &quot;not carried&quot;, &quot;worn&quot; and &quot;not worn&quot;. To be precise, if a form of <i>to be carried</i> or <i>to be worn</i> is not followed by any other description, then &quot;the player&quot; is assumed to be doing the carrying or wearing.
