<p>
<p>An action is an impulse by the player to do something. This may or may not be a reasonable aspiration, and may or may not be achieved. The player's exploration of an interactive fiction is made by a sequence of actions, so much of the designing process comes down to responding to these actions.
<p>
<p>We write actions using present participles. For instance, if the player types &quot;take napkin&quot; or &quot;get the napkin&quot; or something similar then the resulting action would be written as:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">taking the napkin</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>The details of what words the player actually typed are unimportant to us: we deal only in actions.
<p>
<p>Every action ends in success or failure. In this context, success means only that the player's intention has been fulfilled. If the player sets out to take the napkin, but finds a million-pound banknote in its folds instead, the action will be deemed to be a failure.
