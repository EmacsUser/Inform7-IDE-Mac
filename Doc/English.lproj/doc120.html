<p>We have already seen the Table of Rankings, which Inform uses automatically to score the progress of the current game. Here is a more general example:
<p>
<p><center><img src=table2.tiff></center>
<p>
<p>After the two titling lines, each line represents one row in the table, and entries on a line must be separated by at least one tab character. A table must occupy a single whole paragraph, with no skipped lines or missing entries.
<p>
<p>The top line is a title, the first word of which must be the word 'Table'. We can then either give a table number (this need not actually be a number: Table C2, or some such, would be fine), or give a name, or both - as in this case. The possible titling formats are:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">Table 2.3<br>Table of Population Statistics<br>Table 2.3 - Population Statistics</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>In the last example we could call the table either &quot;Table 2.3&quot; or &quot;Table of Population Statistics&quot;.
<p>
<p>Each column then has a name, and the contents must all be the same kind of value. Here the &quot;Score&quot; column contains only numbers and the &quot;Rank&quot; column only text, but any kinds of value will do, so long as all the entries in the column are mutually compatible. (Mixing rooms and things in a single column would be fine, as these can be reconciled, but mixing numbers and rooms would not.)
