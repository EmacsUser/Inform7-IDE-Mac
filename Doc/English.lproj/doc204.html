<p>
<p>In the example game &quot;Lies&quot;, we are going to look for subtleties of wording in order to allow the player to lie down in three different ways. To set the scene, and make new actions to provide for two of these ways:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Lies&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Laundry is a room. &quot;An old Limehouse haunt, the Chinese laundry used by the down-trodden wives of the Tong of the Black Scorpion.&quot; The vast marble sink is here. &quot;There is nothing obviously oriental about the vast marble sink, which is large enough to lie down inside. A wooden-rack floor, equipped for easy drainage, turns out also to be equipped for snagging the shoes of passers-by.&quot; The sink is an enterable container, fixed in place.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Lying down is an action applying to nothing. Report lying down: say &quot;You lie down for a while in the middle of the Laundry, wondering about the point of existence, then get up again.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Lying near is an action applying to one thing. Report lying near: say &quot;You lie down next to [the noun] for a while, mumbling to yourself.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of lying near the sink, say &quot;Lying down close to the cool butcher's marble slabs of the sink, your attention is caught by the sight of coolie shoes through a floor-level grille for ventilation. The game is afoot!&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>So far, so good. Now for the grammar, where we create two new tokens: one for each of two groups of alternative prepositions.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;beneath/under/by/near/beside/alongside/against&quot; or &quot;next to&quot; or &quot;in front of&quot; as &quot;[beside]&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;on/in/inside&quot; or &quot;on top of&quot; as &quot;[within]&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;lie down&quot; as lying down.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;lie down [within] [something]&quot; as entering.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;lie [beside] [something]&quot; or &quot;lie down [beside] [something]&quot; as lying near.
</font></blockquote><p>
