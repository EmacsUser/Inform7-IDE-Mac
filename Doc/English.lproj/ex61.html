<p>Going is an action defined like any other: it is the one which happens when the player tries to go from one location to another. But it is unlike other actions because it happens in two locations, not just one, and has other complications such as vehicles and doors to contend with. To make it easier to write legible and flexible rules, &quot;going&quot; is allowed to be described in a number of special ways not open to other actions, as demonstrated by the following example game:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('&quot;Going Going&quot;\n\nThe Catalogue Room is east of the Front Stacks. South of the Catalogue Room is the Musicology Section.\n\nInstead of going nowhere from the Front Stacks, say &quot;Bookcases obstruct almost all passages out of here.&quot;\n\nInstead of going nowhere, say &quot;You really can\'t wander around at random in the Library.&quot;\n\nBefore going to the Catalogue Room, say &quot;You emerge back into the Catalogue Room.&quot;\n\n\n')"><img border=0 src=paste.png></a> &quot;Going Going&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Catalogue Room is east of the Front Stacks. South of the Catalogue Room is the Musicology Section.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of going nowhere from the Front Stacks, say &quot;Bookcases obstruct almost all passages out of here.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of going nowhere, say &quot;You really can't wander around at random in the Library.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before going to the Catalogue Room, say &quot;You emerge back into the Catalogue Room.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Note that &quot;going nowhere&quot; means trying a map connection which is blank, and if no rules intervene then &quot;You can't go that way&quot; is normally printed. Unless &quot;nowhere&quot; is specified, descriptions of going apply only when there is a map connection. So &quot;going from the Musicology Section&quot; would not match if the player were trying to go east from there, since there is no map connection to the east. Similarly, &quot;going somewhere&quot; excludes blank connections.
<p>
<p>The places gone &quot;from&quot; or &quot;to&quot; can be regions instead of rooms. This is convenient when there are several different ways into or out of an area of map but a common rule needs to apply to all: so, for example,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before going from the Cultivated Land to the Wilderness, ...
<br>Before going nowhere from the Wilderness, say &quot;Tangled brush forces you back.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(Note that it must be &quot;going nowhere from the Wilderness&quot;, not &quot;...in the Wilderness&quot;.)

<a name="e57"><a href=ex57.html#e57><img border=0 src=../FlipClosed.png></a> <font color="#800000">Example (*).</font> <i>A "go back" command that keeps track of the direction from which the player came, and sends him back.</i><p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#e0e0e0" width=100%><tr><td><font face="lucida grande,geneva,arial,tahoma,verdana,helvetica,helv" size=2><a name="e61"><a href=doc87.html#e61><img border=0 src=../FlipOpen.png></a> <font color="#800000"><b>Example</b> (**).</font> <i>If the player tries to go a valid direction while on a supporter, make him stand up first; if he tries to go a nonexistent one, print a special refusal.</i><p>
<p>
<p>The default behavior of Inform is that if the player asks to go some direction while he is sitting down, he'll be told to get up first. If we wanted to make life a little easier, we might add a rule to do this automatically for him:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('Before going somewhere when the player is on a supporter (called the chaise):\n\tsay &quot;(first getting off [the chaise])[line break]&quot;;\n\ttry exiting.\n\n\n')"><img border=0 src=paste.png></a> Before going somewhere when the player is on a supporter (called the chaise):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;(first getting off [the chaise])[line break]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try exiting.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now the player will always get up before trying to walk out of a room; and the fact that we've said &quot;going somewhere&quot; means that this rule will not occur if the direction typed is not valid.
<p>
<p>Speaking of invalid directions, it is a little strange to have the parser tell the player to stand up in order to go some direction that doesn't lead anywhere. This can lead to somewhat annoying exchanges like this:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">>e
<br>You'll have to get off the boulder first.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">>out
<br>You get off the boulder.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Hillside
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">You can see a boulder here.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">>e
<br>You can't go that way.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We could override this too, like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('Instead of going nowhere when the player is on a supporter (called the divan):\n\tsay &quot;Nothing interesting lies in that direction, even if you weren\'t lazing about on [the divan].&quot;\n\n')"><img border=0 src=paste.png></a> Instead of going nowhere when the player is on a supporter (called the divan):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Nothing interesting lies in that direction, even if you weren't lazing about on [the divan].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
