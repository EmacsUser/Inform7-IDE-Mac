<p>When we write:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A dead end is usually dark.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>we are saying that it will be dark rather than lighted unless we should specify otherwise. So it would be fine to add:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Tortuous Alcove is lighted.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>because although dead ends are usually dark, this one is evidently an exception. On the other hand, if we had originally written
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A dead end is always dark.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>then Inform would not have permitted any exception to be made, and would have reported a problem if we had tried to make the Tortuous Alcove lighted. Besides &quot;usually&quot; and &quot;always&quot;, we can also employ &quot;seldom&quot; and &quot;never&quot;, which are their negatives. Thus, &quot;never lighted&quot; means the same as &quot;always dark&quot;.

<table border=0 bgcolor="#e0e0e0" width=100%><tr><td><font face="lucida grande,geneva,arial,tahoma,verdana,helvetica,helv" size=2><a name="e106"><a href=doc46.html#e106><img border=0 src=../FlipOpen.png></a> <font color="#800000"><b>Example</b> (*).</font> <i>A staircase always open and never openable.</i><p>
<p>
<p>In a game with many staircases, we might want:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('A staircase is a kind of door. A staircase is always open. A staircase is never openable.\n\n\n')"><img border=0 src=paste.png></a> A staircase is a kind of door. A staircase is always open. A staircase is never openable.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Defining the staircase this way means that we will never be able to get away with (for instance) a folding ladder into the attic which is sometimes closed up. So alternatively we might do
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('A staircase is a kind of door. A staircase is usually open. A staircase is seldom openable.\n\n\n')"><img border=0 src=paste.png></a> A staircase is a kind of door. A staircase is usually open. A staircase is seldom openable.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We could then write a rule so that whenever the player types CLIMB [any staircase], the command is diverted to an enter command, while all other doors refuse to respond to such treatment.
<p>
<p>But these are refinements for a later chapter.
