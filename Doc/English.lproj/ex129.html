<p>
<p>A variable, as we have seen, is a name for a value which changes, though always remaining of the same kind. For instance, if &quot;target&quot; is a number variable (or &quot;number that varies&quot;) then it may change value from 2 to 4, but not from 2 to &quot;fishknife&quot;.
<p>
<p>To make complicated decisions, phrases often need to remember values on a temporary basis. We have already seen this for the counter in a &quot;repeat&quot; loop, which exists only inside that loop, and then is no longer needed. Now we define named values which exist only inside the current phrase. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">let outer bull be 25;
<br>let the current appearance be &quot;reddish brown&quot;;
<br>let the special room be Marley Wood;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>creates temporary variables &quot;outer bull&quot;, &quot;current appearance&quot; and &quot;special room&quot;. The kinds of these are deduced from the values given, so that, for instance,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">say &quot;The outer bull scores [the outer bull in words] when you practice archery in [special room].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>produces
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The outer bull scores twenty-five when you practice archery in Marley Wood.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Temporary variables made by &quot;let&quot; are only temporarily in existence while a phrase is being carried out. Their values often change: we could say
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">let x be 10;
<br>change x to 11;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>for instance, or indeed we could &quot;let x be 10&quot; and then &quot;let x be 11&quot;. But although we are allowed to change the value, we are not allowed to change the kind of value. The name &quot;x&quot; must always have the same kind of value throughout the phrase to which it belongs, so the following will not be allowed:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">let x be 45;
<br>change x to &quot;Norway&quot;;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(The difference between &quot;let&quot; and &quot;change&quot; is that &quot;let&quot; can create a new temporary variable, whereas &quot;change&quot; can only alter one which already exists: on the other hand, &quot;change&quot; can change many other things as well, whereas &quot;let&quot; applies only to temporary variables.)

<table border=0 bgcolor="#e0e0e0" width=100%><tr><td><font face="lucida grande,geneva,arial,tahoma,verdana,helvetica,helv" size=2><a name="e129"><a href=doc147.html#e129><img border=0 src=../FlipOpen.png></a> <font color="#800000"><b>Example</b> (**).</font> <i>A worked example using a new kind of value, "colour", within phrases to talk about tinted wallpaper.</i><p>
<p>
<p>Kinds of value come into their own inside phrases, as the following worked example may suggest. Suppose we have declared that:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Colour is a kind of value. The colours are green, aquamarine and darkish purple.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The effect is that &quot;colour&quot; is now a kind of value on a par with, for instance, &quot;number&quot;. We are allowed, for instance, in a phrase to write
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">let the tint be aquamarine;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>to create a temporary quantity called &quot;tint&quot;, which always holds a colour, initially aquamarine. (If, later in the same phrase, we were to try &quot;let the tint be 15&quot;, we would be rebuffed because a colour can't be a number or vice versa. The tint may change colour, but must always be a colour.) We can also
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">say &quot;The wallpaper has a distinctly [tint] wash.&quot;;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>which results in
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The wallpaper has a distinctly green wash.
<br>The wallpaper has a distinctly aquamarine wash.
<br>The wallpaper has a distinctly darkish purple wash.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>as may be. (Oscar Wilde's last words: &quot;Either that wallpaper goes or I do.&quot;) As might be expected, we can also test conditions:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the tint is darkish purple then ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>When a property is created that has the same name as a kind of value, like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A door is allowed to have a colour.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>it becomes a property whose value is required at all times to fit that quality. Thus
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The colour of a door is usually green.
<br>The colour of the lounge door is aquamarine.
<br>...
<br>say &quot;The lounge door is [colour of lounge door].&quot;;
<br>if the colour of the lounge door is green then ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>However, this is obviously rather cumbersome in English, so we can also more naturally write any of these:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A door is usually green.
<br>The lounge door is aquamarine.
<br>if the lounge door is green then ...
<br>Before putting something into an aquamarine container: ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>which are unambiguous since &quot;green&quot; is a colour and in the context of an object must imply the colour of that object.
