<p>
<p>Reports of problems, as we have seen, often quote back the source to justify themselves, and therefore need to give a reference. Saying &quot;(Midsummer Day, line 2017)&quot; is all very well, but is not a very natural or helpful way to identify where the problem has turned up. Because of this, Inform allows us to subdivide a design using headings.
<p>
<p>A sentence which is the only one in its paragraph and which begins with any of the words &quot;volume&quot;, &quot;book&quot;, &quot;part&quot;, &quot;chapter&quot; or &quot;section&quot; is considered to be a heading or a sub-heading. It is therefore ignored except for purposes of reporting errors, where it is used as follows:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">In Part the First, Chapter 1 - Attic Area:</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">>--> You wrote 'South of the Attic is the Winery' (Curses, line 23), but in another sentence 'South of the Attic is the Old Furniture' (Curses, line 22): this looks like a contradiction, which might be because I have misunderstood what was meant to be the subject of one or both of those sentences.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">In Chapter 2 - Deeper In:</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">>--> You wrote 'The Disused Observatory is south of the Dark Room' (Curses, line 91), but in another sentence 'South of the Dark Room is the Cupboard' (Curses, line 95): again, this looks like a contradiction.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>If the first paragraph of the interactive fiction consists only of a single quoted piece of text, then that's the title of the work. An author can also be given, as follows:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Spellbreaker&quot; by Dave Lebling</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>This completes the groundwork, and we are ready to begin on simulating a world to explore.
