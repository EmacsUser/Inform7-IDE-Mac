<p>
<p>A daemon is a rule which is applied every turn, but only when it is active: the rest of the time it sleeps. Traditionally, rules like this in interactive fiction have been imagined as being somehow independently acting, hence the term &quot;daemon&quot;. There's not much to say about daemons:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">The lightning daemon: say &quot;Lightning strikes, suddenly.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">In the Keep is a lever. The lever is fixed in place. Instead of pulling the lever: say &quot;Zzzing...&quot;; start the lightning daemon. Instead of pushing the lever: say &quot;Zzzap...&quot;; stop the lightning daemon.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>The name of a daemon must always have &quot;daemon&quot; as its final word. When play begins, daemons are normally asleep, so if we need one of them to be active right from the start then we must add a further rule:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">When play begins, start the lightning daemon.</font></blockquote>
