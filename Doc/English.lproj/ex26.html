<p>Adding to the previous example game, we apply rules which depend on travelling by a particular vehicle:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The book trolley is in the Musicology Section. &quot;The book trolley, a sort of motorised tractor for trundling around through the stacks, is parked here.&quot; The trolley is a vehicle. Instead of going nowhere by the trolley, say &quot;Don't go crashing the trolley into walls.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of going to the Front Stacks by the trolley, say &quot;The Front Stacks are far too confined for the trolley to manoeuvre into them.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And, lastly, rules which apply to movements through particular doors:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The green baize door is east of the Catalogue Room and west of the Clerk's Office. The green baize door is an open door.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before going through the green baize door, say &quot;Through you go...&quot; After going through the green baize door: try looking; say &quot;...and here you are.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(Note that these apply whether the action is &quot;going east&quot; or &quot;entering the green baize door&quot;, each having the same effect.) The last rule is worth a second look: the normal way that a &quot;going&quot; action is reported is to produce the room description of the new location. So if an &quot;after&quot; rule stops the action before we get to reporting, we have to produce any room description by hand (hence the &quot;try looking&quot; to cause the looking action). Alternatively, we could simply say something and let the normal course of events take place:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After going through the green baize door: say &quot;...and here you are:&quot;; continue the action.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Finally, going is an action which can also happen while the player is pushing something from one room to another, and we can describe this like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of going from the Office with the trolley, say &quot;But it looks perfectly placed here. Why push any further?&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>

<p>
<p>The Inform Designer's Manual, Fourth Edition, offers the example of a car that cannot be driven when turned off, or ridden into rooms which are not designated as roads. We can do the same:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('&quot;Exercise 23&quot;\n\nA road is a kind of room.

</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A road is a kind of room. Definition: a room is offroad if it is not a road.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of going by something (called the auto) to somewhere offroad:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You can't drive [the auto] off-road.&quot;

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Trafalgar Square is a road. &quot;The Square is overlooked by a pillared statue of Admiral Lord Horatio Nelson (no relation), naval hero and convenience to pigeons since 1812.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>

</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The car is a vehicle in Trafalgar Square. The ignition is a device. The ignition is part of the car. Instead of going by the car when the ignition is switched off: say &quot;The ignition is off at the moment.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Of course, this is all a historical curiosity, given that since the Inform Designer's Manual was written, much of Trafalgar Square has been made pedestrian-only.
