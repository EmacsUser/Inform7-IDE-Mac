<p>
<p>At the start of this chapter we saw that &quot;+&quot; could be used to combine two number values into one:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">change the score to the score + 4
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Inform generally expects to apply the &quot;+&quot; sign only to two numbers, so we cannot normally apply &quot;+&quot; to values like these:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Colour is a kind of value. The colours are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>There will be more about arithmetic on new kinds of value in the chapter on Units, but it may be useful to note that although we cannot (ordinarily) add up colours, we do automatically have two ways to make new colours from old:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">the colour after C
<br>the colour before C
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>produce the next, and the previous colour respectively, in order of their declaration. Thus &quot;the colour after red&quot; is orange; &quot;the colour before blue&quot; is green. The values wrap around, that is, &quot;the colour before red&quot; is violet and &quot;the colour after violet&quot; is red.
<p>
<p>We are also allowed to use number-like comparisons with new kinds of value. Thus &quot;red < yellow&quot; is true, while &quot;green >= violet&quot; is not. Again, more on comparisons in the chapter on units.
