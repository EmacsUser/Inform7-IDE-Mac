<p>A variable, as we have seen, is a name for a value which changes, though always remaining of the same kind. For instance, if &quot;target&quot; is a number variable (or &quot;number that varies&quot;) then it may change value from 2 to 4, but not from 2 to &quot;fishknife&quot;.
<p>
<p>To make complicated decisions, phrases often need to remember values on a temporary basis. We have already seen this for the counter in a &quot;repeat&quot; loop, which exists only inside that loop, and then is no longer needed. Now we define named values which exist only inside the current phrase. For instance:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">let outer bull be 25;<br>let the current appearance be &quot;reddish brown&quot;;<br>let the special room be Marley Wood;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>creates temporary variables &quot;outer bull&quot;, &quot;current appearance&quot; and &quot;special room&quot;. The kinds of these are deduced from the values given, so that, for instance,
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">say &quot;The outer bull scores [the outer bull in words] when you practice archery in [special room].&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>produces
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">The outer bull scores twenty-five when you practice archery in Marley Wood.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>Temporary variables made by &quot;let&quot; are only temporarily in existence while a phrase is being carried out; and we can let them be one thing, then another, then another still during the same phrase. But although we are allowed to change the value of such a variable, we are not allowed to change the kind of value, so something like this will not be allowed:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">let x be 45;<br>let x be &quot;Norway&quot;;</font></blockquote>
