<p>Welcome to Inform 7, a design system for interactive fiction based on natural language.
<p>
<p>Interactive fiction is a literary form which involves programming a computer so that it presents a reader with a text which can be explored. Inform aims to make the burden of learning to program such texts as light as possible, and moreover to live up to Donald Knuth's doctrine (&quot;Literate Programming&quot;, 1981) that:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Programming is best regarded as the process of creating works of literature, which are meant to be read... so we ought to address them to people, not to machines.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This new release of Inform is a radical departure from most previous approaches to interactive fiction, though in some ways it harks back to early work on artificial intelligence such as &quot;SHRDLU&quot;, and it is still experimental.
<p>
<p>Inform 7 is very different from Inform 6, which newcomers will not need to know anything about. For information about Inform 6, see <b>www.inform-fiction.org</b>.
<p>
<p>These notes aim to be concise. They are arranged so that the reader can, in principle, write whole works of fiction as early as the end of Chapter 2. Each subsequent chapter then extends the range of techniques available to make livelier and more intriguing situations.

<table border=0 bgcolor="#e0e0e0" width=100%><tr><td><font face="lucida grande,geneva,arial,tahoma,verdana,helvetica,helv" size=2><a name="e49"><a href=doc1.html#e49><img border=0 src=../FlipOpen.png></a> <font color="#800000"><b>Example</b> (*).</font> <i>An explanation of the asterisks attached to examples can be found here. Click the "flippy triangle" next to the word "Example" to read more.</i><p>
<p>
<p>Almost all of the examples give sample Inform source which would clutter up the main text of the documentation if it were quoted in full. Examples tend to be included either because they are frequently asked for, or because they show how to achieve some surprising effect.
<p>
<p>The examples are loosely graded by difficulty, that is, by how tricky the source text turns out to be: if they were exercises in a textbook, the asterisks would indicate how many marks each question scores. As a general rule:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">* - A simple example, fairly easily guessed.
<br>** - A complicated or surprising example.
<br>*** - An example needing detailed knowledge of many other aspects of the system.
<br>**** - A complete scenario, containing material not necessarily relevant to the topic being demonstrated.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>In general, the documentation's main text tries never to assume knowledge of material which has not yet appeared, but the trickier examples almost always need to break this rule.
