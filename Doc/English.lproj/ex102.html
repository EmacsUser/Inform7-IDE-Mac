<p>
<p>The useful substitution &quot;[list of <i>description</i>]&quot; prints out as an English sentence list of all the objects which match the given description. For instance,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;The places you can go are [list of rooms].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Any description can be given and, as we shall see, descriptions can be very flexible indeed:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Mr Darcy glares proudly at you. He is wearing [list of things worn by Darcy] and carrying [list of things carried by Darcy].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And, if this were from a dramatisation of the novel by Miss Fielding rather than Miss Austen, we might find:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Mr Darcy glares proudly at you. He is wearing a pair of Newcastle United boxer shorts and carrying a self-help book.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>If the description matches nothing - for instance, if Darcy has empty hands - then &quot;nothing&quot; is printed. A more insidious problem is that the list may end up either singular or plural. We might be expecting that the example above will produce something like:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The places you can go are Old Bailey, Bridget's Flat and TV Centre.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>But if there is only one room, then the result would be:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The places you can go are Bridget's Flat.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>which is wrong. We can get around this with the substitution:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;The places you can go [is/are list of rooms].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>which uses &quot;is&quot; or &quot;are&quot; as appropriate. Lastly, we can also make the items listed take the definite article by writing:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Mr Darcy impatiently bundles [the list of things carried by Darcy] into your hands and stomps out of the room.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>which might result in
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Mr Darcy impatiently bundles the self-help book and the Christmas card into your hands and stomps out of the room.
</font></blockquote><p>

<p>It is straightforward to make a rule that anything with parts must mention all those parts during an EXAMINE command:
