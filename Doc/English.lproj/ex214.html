<p>It may be worth noting in passing that number specifications, like all other kinds of value, can be understood in typed commands. (See the chapter on Understanding for more on what can go in such square brackets.) For instance:

<p>This fudges slightly, since an odd-length string will be divided into uneven halves. Keeping track of fractional inches would complicate matters, though, so let's assume for now that this doesn't matter.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The player carries a string.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Scissors Room is a room.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The string repository contains 35 strings.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Since our initial string is 36 inches long and it is impossible for the player to divide it into pieces smaller than an inch each, we need a total of 36 items to represent all the string-bits: one that the player carries at the outset, and 35 others. We should bear in mind that it is usually a good idea to use the smallest number of spare objects we can get away with: writing a game that required 1000 strings in the string repository would place silly demands on the resources of the system, so it's best to avoid that sort of thing if possible.
<p>
<p>Now with a bit of fiddling we can also teach Inform to recognize descriptors such as &quot;the shortest string&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Ordinariness is a kind of value. The ordinarinesses are longest, medium, shortest. A string has an ordinariness. Understand the ordinariness property as referring to a string.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: a string is small if its length is 2 in or less. Definition: a string is large if its length is 20 in or more.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before reading a command:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let upper measure be the length of the largest visible string;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let lower measure be the length of the smallest visible string;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with item running through strings
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;change the ordinariness of the item to medium;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the length of the item is the upper measure, change the item to longest;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the length of the item is the lower measure, change the item to shortest;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end repeat.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After reading a command:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player's command includes &quot;shorter&quot;, replace the matched text with &quot;shortest&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player's command includes &quot;longer&quot;, replace the matched text with &quot;longest&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of tying a string to a string:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move the second noun to the string repository;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;change the length of the noun to the length of the noun plus the length of the second noun;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decrease the length of the noun by 1 inch;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You end up with [a noun], as some is taken up by the knot.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;trim string by 4 in / cut longer string in half / cut longest string in half / cut shortest string in half / g / g / tie longest string to shortest string / tie longest string to medium string / i&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This is still a little disappointing because we cannot refer to strings by their lengths, as in &quot;the 2 inch string&quot; and so on. This is a bit more challenging, but can be done; we'll return to the problem in a later example.
