<p>
<p>Bibliographic data is useful for two reasons. Firstly, it enables the equivalent of a title page to be printed - traditionally called the &quot;banner&quot; - at the start of play; secondly, Inform uses it to generate the equivalent of a library card for the work, which can be used by other programs to help organise, sort and classify interactive fiction. If the card is given to any other program on any other machine (or an Internet-based archive) then, in principle, that system can know about our work of fiction without a human librarian having to get hold of a copy, play it and laboriously copy out the details.
<p>
<p>The &quot;library card&quot; is not of course a physical card, but a small &quot;metadata&quot; file which could potentially be transmitted quickly across the Internet. It contains no personal data other than what you choose to put on it, using the above sentences: it does not, for instance, identify your computer or IP address. In any case Inform does not send it anywhere, but merely keeps an up-to-date copy within the project so that other applications may make use of it as needed. You can always see (a representation of) the current library card for a project at the foot of the Contents index.
<p>
<p>Authors are asked to play fair, in return, by writing sensible and useful bibliographic information for any work which is likely to circulate to other people; by being honest (in particular, not impersonating others); and by conforming to standard practice.
<p>
<p>Information which is not supplied will be filled in automatically as follows:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Story title: Untitled
<br>Story author: Anonymous
<br>Story headline: An Interactive Fiction
<br>Story genre: Fiction
<br>Release number: 1
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The &quot;story genre&quot; is not used in the banner at all, and exists purely to help librarians. If it is at all possible to do so, authors are asked to use one of the following standard categories:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Fairy Tale, Fantasy, Fiction, Historical, Horror, Humour, Mystery, Parody, Romance, Science Fiction, Surreal
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Each new project created by Inform is allocated a unique identification number (the equivalent of the ISBN of a printed book) and this is copied onto the &quot;library card&quot; for the benefit of Internet-based libraries which may one day accession the work. The ID number will be unique to this one work out of all of the IF ever created: <b>unless</b> we do something to break this ourselves. For instance, if we take an existing project, copy it as a file, then work divergently on the original and on the copy so that they become two radically different works, they will still each have the same ID. This is a bad thing: if we want to duplicate a project but then turn it into something new, the best way to do that is to create a new project, and to copy and paste the source from the old to the new.
<p>
<p>Under Mac OS X, the &quot;library card&quot; file format has the file extension &quot;.iFiction&quot;. The format itself is common to all platforms; on Mac OS X, it is also compatible with the stand-alone interpreter &quot;Zoom&quot;, by Andrew Hunter.
