<p>
<p>So far every &quot;Understand&quot; sentence has ended with &quot;as&quot; and a description of an action. But we can also use &quot;Understand&quot; to supply new ways to talk about things and even values. For instance, if we create:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A brass lantern is in the Building.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>then it can be called &quot;brass&quot;, or &quot;lantern&quot;, but not &quot;lamp&quot;: Inform does not really know what these words mean, and has no grasp of synonyms. We can arrange for &quot;lamp&quot; to work as well like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;lamp&quot; as the lantern.
<br>Understand &quot;old lamp&quot; as the lantern.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>With care, we can do the same trick for entire kinds of thing at once. It is not ordinarily the case that a thing can be called by the name of its kind: if we put a woman called April into a room, then she can usually be called &quot;April&quot;, but not &quot;woman&quot;. (The exception is when we do not specify any name for her - in that case, Inform will give up and call her just &quot;woman&quot;.) So there is not usually any form of words which can refer to anything of a given kind. If we should want this, we have to say so explicitly:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;machine&quot; as a device.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Device is a kind, so now the word &quot;machine&quot; can be used to refer to any device: if there are two in the same place, the result might play out like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">>switch machine on
<br>Which do you mean, the bale twiner or the grain thresher?
<br>>twiner
<br>You watch absorbed as a perfect cube of hay is trussed up like a parcel.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Similarly, we might conceivably want to allow new ways to recognise values - in this case, a number:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;eleventy-one&quot; as 111.
</font></blockquote><p>
