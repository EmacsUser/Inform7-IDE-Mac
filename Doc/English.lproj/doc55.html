<p>It is in describing whole categories of actions that Inform really capitalises on the concise, expressive power of natural language, and this will enable us to design much more sophisticated rules with only a handful of extra words typed.
<p>
<p>Any object mentioned can be described in a wide range of ways. Instead of writing &quot;the cucumber sandwich&quot;, we could say &quot;something edible&quot;, or even just &quot;something&quot;. The same goes for any other properties and kinds, of course:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of throwing something at a closed openable door, say &quot;Or you could just use the handle like anyone else, of course.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>We can also add a requirement about where the action is taking place.
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of taking something in the Supernatural Void, say &quot;In this peculiar mist you feel unable to grasp anything.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>Like the objects to which the action applies, the location can itself be vaguely defined:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of listening in a dead end, say &quot;You strain to hear further clues as to the course of the underground river, but to no avail.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>It may be worth recalling here that when we create a new kind of value, we also create new adjectives which can be used to describe things:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">Colour is a kind of value. The colours are red, blue and green. A building block is a kind of thing. A building block has a colour. Instead of taking a green building block, say &quot;For some reason you have an aversion to the colour green.&quot;</font></blockquote>
