<p>
<p>We have already used the example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Loving relates various people to one person.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Let us create a verb which expresses this:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The verb to love (he loves, they love, he loved, he is loved) implies the loving relation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Note that we have omitted one of the parts of the verb. Actually we can legally miss out any of them, but the result is that the usages missed out will not be understood by Inform. In this case, Inform will understand
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Elizabeth loves Darcy.
<br>if anybody has been loved by Darcy, ...
<br>someone who is loved by Elizabeth
<br>the number of women who love Darcy
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>but it will not understand
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Elizabeth is loving Darcy.
<br>if Darcy is loving anybody, ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>because we did not supply the present participle &quot;he is loving&quot; as part of the definition of the verb. (That was deliberate, because the verb &quot;to love&quot; isn't used that way.)
<p>
<p>Similarly, using our reciprocated relation for mere acquaintanceship,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Meeting relates people to each other. The verb to know (he knows, they know, he knew, he is known) implies the meeting relation. Elizabeth knows Mr Wickham. Mr Wickham knows Mr Darcy.
</font></blockquote><p>

<p>
<p>The following is best tested by experimentally kissing and/or attacking, and typing RELATIONS after every change to see the effect.
