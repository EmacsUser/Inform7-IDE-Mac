<p>Kinds of value come into their own inside phrases, as the following worked example may suggest. Suppose we have declared that:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Colour is a kind of value. The colours are green, aquamarine and darkish purple.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The effect is that &quot;colour&quot; is now a kind of value on a par with, for instance, &quot;number&quot;. We are allowed, for instance, in a phrase to write
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">let the tint be aquamarine;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>to create a temporary quantity called &quot;tint&quot;, which always holds a colour, initially aquamarine. (If, later in the same phrase, we were to try &quot;let the tint be 15&quot;, we would be rebuffed because a colour can't be a number or vice versa. The tint may change colour, but must always be a colour.) We can also
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">say &quot;The wallpaper has a distinctly [tint] wash.&quot;;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>which results in
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The wallpaper has a distinctly green wash.
<br>The wallpaper has a distinctly aquamarine wash.
<br>The wallpaper has a distinctly darkish purple wash.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>as may be. As might be expected, we can also test conditions:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the tint is darkish purple then ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>When a property is created that has the same name as a kind of value, like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A door is allowed to have a colour.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>it becomes a property whose value is required at all times to fit that quality. Thus
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The colour of a door is usually green.
<br>The colour of the lounge door is aquamarine.
<br>...
<br>say &quot;The lounge door is [colour of lounge door].&quot;;
<br>if the colour of the lounge door is green then ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>However, this is obviously rather cumbersome in English, so we can also more naturally write any of these:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A door is usually green.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The lounge door is aquamarine.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the lounge door is green then ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before putting something into an aquamarine container: ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>which are unambiguous since &quot;green&quot; is a colour and in the context of an object must imply the colour of that object.
