<p>
<p>No. No computer does, and Inform does not even try to read the whole wide range of text: it is a practical tool for a particular purpose, and it deals only with certain forms of sentence useful to that purpose. Inform source text may look like &quot;natural language&quot;, the language we find natural among ourselves, but in the end it is a computer programming language. Many things which seem reasonable to the human reader are not understood by Inform. For instance, Inform understands
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">something which is carried by the player
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>but not (at present, anyway)
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">something which the player carries
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>even though both are perfectly good English. So it is not always safe to assume that Inform will understand any reasonable instruction it is given: when in doubt, we must go back to the manual.
<p>
<p>More philosophically, to &quot;understand&quot; involves contextual knowledge. Just because Inform recognises and acts on a sentence, does it really understand what we meant? It will turn out that Inform is both good and bad at this. For instance, from
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Mr Darcy wears a top hat.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Inform will correctly deduce that Darcy is a person, because inanimate objects do not ordinarily wear clothes, and that the top hat is clothing. But it will not automatically know that Darcy is a man rather than a woman because it does not know the social convention implied by &quot;Mr&quot;. Moreover, if instead we had written
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Mr Darcy carries a top hat.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>then Inform would not guess that the top hat is clothing. This is because it does not have the vast vocabulary and experience of a human reader: it is probably discovering the word &quot;hat&quot; for the first time.
<p>
<p>Finally, it is best to avoid ambiguities rather than rely on Inform to know which meaning is patently absurd. For instance, in
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Heatwave bone breaks clog hospital.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(a headline once printed by the <i>Oxford Mail</i> newspaper) a human reader quickly realises that there is no clog hospital being broken. But if Inform had been taught the verbs <i>to break</i> and <i>to clog</i> then that is exactly the conclusion it would have drawn. Or an example which genuinely arose in beta-testing:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The life support unit fits the egg.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>in which Inform construed the verb as <i>support</i> and not <i>fits</i>, and then created items called &quot;the life&quot; (plural) and &quot;unit fits the egg&quot;.
<p>
<p>That disclaimer completes the groundwork, and we are ready to begin on simulating a world to explore.
