<p>We will occasionally need to perform more complex calculations with time, and in order to do that, we have a way to convert the time of day to numbers. Thus the phrase &quot;the minutes part of ...&quot; takes a time and produces a number from 0 to 59; similarly &quot;the hours part of ...&quot; extracts a number from 0 to 23, using the twenty-four hour clock.
<p>
<p>To go the other way, we can convert any number to a duration by writing &quot;minutes&quot; or &quot;hours&quot; after it. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('The clock error is a number that varies. To thump the mechanism: change the clock error to a random number from -10 to 10.\n\nThe broken grandfather clock is in the Chamber. &quot;An erratic grandfather clock seems to say it is [clock error minutes after the time of day].&quot;\n\nWhen play begins, thump the mechanism. Instead of attacking the broken clock: thump the mechanism; say &quot;You thump the clock, which now reads [clock error minutes after the time of day].&quot;.\n\n\n')"><img border=0 src=paste.png></a> The clock error is a number that varies. To thump the mechanism: change the clock error to a random number from -10 to 10.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The broken grandfather clock is in the Chamber. &quot;An erratic grandfather clock seems to say it is [clock error minutes after the time of day].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When play begins, thump the mechanism. Instead of attacking the broken clock: thump the mechanism; say &quot;You thump the clock, which now reads [clock error minutes after the time of day].&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Note that &quot;clock error&quot; is a number, but &quot;clock error minutes&quot; is a time.
