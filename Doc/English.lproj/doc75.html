<p>
<p>Inform begins knowing a set of standard phrases, and allows us to define new ones: the current stock is called the &quot;phrasebook&quot;, and can be browsed at the Index panel. Here is a simple definition of a new phrase:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">To spring the trap: say &quot;'Sproing!' go the hinges and, with a flash of silver, the enormous blades whisk together!&quot;; end the game in death.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>Now the phrase &quot;spring the trap&quot; is given meaning. Of course it will only happen if our design ever actually calls upon the computer to &quot;spring the trap&quot;, which at present it does not.
<p>
<p>This chapter is about how to define more complicated phrases, and about the special phrases which exist to repeat the same activity over and over, to test conditions and so on.
