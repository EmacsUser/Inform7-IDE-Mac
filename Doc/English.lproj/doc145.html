<p>
<p>When double-quoted matter appears in a column of a table, Inform will normally treat that as text for printing out. The exception is when the column is called &quot;topic&quot;, where it is treated as text for comparing against what the player has typed. There is really only one operation allowed with topic columns, the &quot;...listed in...&quot; construction, but fortunately it is the one most often needed.
<p>
<p>Let us suppose that the Sybil has a penchant for telling passers-by which is the Greek muse for what. We might write:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">After asking the Sybil about a topic listed in the Table of Sybil's Replies, say &quot;The Sybil declaims for a while, the gist being that the muse in question looks after [muse entry].&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>We can then provide a simple table giving her responses:
<p>
<p><center><img src=table12.tiff></center>
<p>
<p>Topics can use the full range of abilities of the &quot;understanding&quot; system which Inform uses to parse text, and which will be the subject of a later chapter. For now, note that the Sybil's topics might equally include &quot;flora/eve&quot; (matching the single word &quot;flora&quot; or the single word &quot;eve&quot;), or something more elaborate such as:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Bridget&quot; or &quot;Bridge&quot; or &quot;Bridget Jones&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
