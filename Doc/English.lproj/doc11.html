<p>Rooms are joined together at their edges by &quot;map connections&quot;, most of which are pathways in one of the eight cardinal compass directions: north, northeast (written without a hyphen), east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest. We also have up and down, suitable for staircases or ladders, and in and out, which are less used but occasionally seem more natural. In real life, people are seldom conscious of their compass bearing when walking around buildings, but it makes a concise and unconfusing way for the player to say where to go next, so is generally accepted as a convention of the genre.
<p>
<p>One of the map connections in the Mammoth Cave simulation was made by the sentence:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">The Debris Room is west of the Crawl.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>Besides reading this sentence at face value, Inform also deduced that the Crawl was probably meant to be east of the Debris Room: in other words, that the path between them is a two-way one. When Inform makes guesses like this, it treats them as being less certain than anything explicitly stated in the source. Inform will quietly overturn its assumption if information later comes to hand which shows that it was wrong. That might happen in this case if a later sentence read:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">The Hidden Alcove is east of the Debris Room.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>These two sentences are not contradictory: Inform allows them both, simply accepting that the world is more complicated than it first assumed. There are relatively few situations where Inform has to make educated guesses, but when it does, it tries always to follow Occam's Razor by constructing the simplest model world consistent with the information in the Source text.
