<p>
<p>The example rule just given demonstrates one of Inform's conventions about punctuation, and is worth pausing to look at again.
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of taking the crate, say &quot;It's far too heavy to lift.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>In English grammar, it's usual to regard full stops and such as closing sentences even when they occur inside quotation marks, provided there is no indication to the contrary, and this is also the rule used by Inform. Thus:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">The description is &quot;Shiny.&quot; It is valuable.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>is read as equivalent to
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">The description is &quot;Shiny.&quot;. It is valuable.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>Sentence breaks like this occur only when the final character of the quoted text is a full stop, question mark or exclamation mark (or one of these three followed by a close bracket) and the next word begins, in the source code, with a capital letter. A paragraph break also divides sentences, behaving as if it were a full stop.
<p>
<p>Text in square brackets [like so] is &quot;comment&quot;, in computing jargon: it is considered as being an aside, a private note by the author, and not read in by Inform. This allows us to make notes to ourselves like so:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">The China Shop is a room. [Remember to work out what happens if the bull gets in here!]</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>As we shall see, Inform source imitates the conventions of printed books whenever there is a question of how to write something not easily fitting into sentences. The first example of this is how Inform handles headings, but to see why these are so useful we first look at Problems.
