<p>
<p>This is a different sort of sentence to any seen so far:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When play begins: start the player at the Library; say &quot;Welcome to Old Marston Grange, a country house cut off by fog.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This is not a passive statement of facts (&quot;The Library is a room&quot;) but takes the form of an instruction to someone: that person is the computer, acting as our agent in talking with the player. It is an example of a &quot;rule&quot;, the analogy being with the rules written inside the box-lid of an old board game, rather than rules in the scientific sense.
<p>
<p>The sentence opens by identifying the circumstances in which the rule applies, leading up to the colon, and then gives a list of things to do, divided by semicolons except that the last ends with a full stop. In this case it's a list of two steps to follow, but rules vary in length from only one step to hundreds.
<p>
<p>There's nothing to stop us laying this out as a vertical list, if we prefer:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When play begins:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;start the player at the Library;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Welcome to Old Marston Grange, a country house cut off by fog.&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
