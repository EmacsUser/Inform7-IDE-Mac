<p>We have now seen several different forms of &quot;Understand&quot; sentence: for instance,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand the colour property as describing a building block.
<br>Understand &quot;mix [colour] paint&quot; as mixing paint.
<br>Understand &quot;rouge&quot; as red.
<br>Understand &quot;curious girl&quot; as Alice.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Any of these may optionally have a condition tacked on: for instance,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;mix [colour] paint&quot; as mixing paint when the location is the Workshop.
<br>Understand &quot;rouge&quot; as red when the make-up set is visible.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>In principle, &quot;when ...&quot; can take in any condition at all. In practice a little care should be exercised not to do anything too slow, or which might have side-effects. (For instance, referring the decision to a phrase which then printed text up would be a bad idea.) Moreover, we must remember that the &quot;noun&quot; and &quot;second noun&quot; are not known yet, nor do we know what the action will be. So we cannot safely say &quot;when the noun is the fir cone&quot;, for instance. If we want more sophisticated handling of such cases, we need to write checking rules and so on in the usual way.
