<p>
<p>During the French Revolution, the French invented and put into use a new Revolutionary calendar. The Revolutionary calendar was established in October 1793, but Year I was made effective on September 22, 1792. The Revolutionary calendar had 12 months of 30 days, plus 5 or 6 leap days (with a rule for leap years).
<p>
<p>The autumn months were given the names Vendemiaire, Brumaire, and Frimaire; the winter months were called Nivose, Pluviose, and Ventose; the spring months were called Germinal, Floreal, and Prairial; and the summer months were called Messidor, Thermidor, and Fructidor. The extra days were called Sans Culottides.
