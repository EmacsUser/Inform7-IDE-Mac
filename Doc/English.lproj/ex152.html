<p>Everything has one and only one kind. This is both good and bad: good for clarity, bad if something needs to behave in two different ways at once. How might we simulate a car with an ignition key, given that no single thing can be both a &quot;vehicle&quot; and a &quot;device&quot; at the same time?
<p>
<p>The Inform world model takes the view that such a car is too complicated to be simulated with a single thing. Instead it should be simulated as a vehicle (the car) which has a device (the ignition) attached. This is done using a third kind of containment to those seen so far (&quot;in...&quot; and &quot;on...&quot;): &quot;part of&quot;.

<p>
<p>The machine and the desk each have several &quot;parts&quot; representing subsidiary pieces of themselves. The desk is a &quot;supporter&quot; (it needs to be, for the liquorice twist to be on top) but also has three &quot;containers&quot; attached, each of which can be opened or closed independently.
<p>
<p>In the interests of realism, the standard rules of play protect these composite things. Thus if the desk were to be moved elsewhere (rolling on sugar casters perhaps) then its parts would move with it, and the player is not allowed to detach parts of things: the drawers can be opened or closed, but not pulled out altogether.

<p>
<p>Here is the essential point: whenever we ATTACH LABEL TO something, it becomes part of that object.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of tieing the red sticky label to something:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the red sticky label is part of the second noun;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You stick [the label] to [the second noun].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And of course the label cannot be stuck to itself or to more than one thing at a time.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before tieing the label to something when the label is part of something:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the label is part of the second noun
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;(first freeing the label)[line break]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;silently try taking the label;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the label is part of something, stop the action;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the player carries the label;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You peel the label off again.&quot;;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Much of the rest is just tidying to make sure that the player's commands are redirected into the right syntax.
<p>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try tieing the label to the noun.

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand the commands &quot;stick&quot; or &quot;apply&quot; as &quot;tie&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We could have created a new &quot;sticking&quot; action, but to keep the example short we will use the built-in &quot;tieing&quot; action instead, and respond to the command &quot;stick&quot; just as if it were &quot;tie&quot;.
