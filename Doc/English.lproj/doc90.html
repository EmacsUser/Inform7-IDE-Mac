<p>
<p>Conditions like &quot;if a woman is holding an animal&quot; allow complicated tests to be performed with a minimum of fuss, but it's rare that we want to know only whether they are true: more likely we also want to know <i>which</i> woman, and <i>which</i> animal.
<p>
<p>For this purpose, we are allowed to supply a name for any such vaguely-described object which comes up, and then to use that name thereafter. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of waiting when a woman (called the kidnapper) is holding an animal (called the pet), say &quot;How can you think of rest when, somewhere out there, [pet] has been cruelly kidnapped by [the kidnapper]?&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Note the brackets, which are essential. The rest of typing &quot;wait&quot; is then
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">How can you think of rest when, somewhere out there, a lapdog has been cruelly kidnapped by Baroness Orczy?
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Of course, that might be just one of many animals held by women in the game. We shall later see ways to go through all of the possibilities found, performing some action with each in turn.
