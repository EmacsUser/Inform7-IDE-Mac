<p>
<p>Sometimes we want to introduce random behaviour into play. We usually do this by generating random values, and then acting differently depending on what they are. The following:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">a random number from 2 to 5</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>produces, as it suggests, a random number drawn from the choices 2, 3, 4 or 5, each of which is equally likely to come up.
<p>
<p>We can also use random conditions:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">if a random chance of 2 in 3 succeeds then ...</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>Here is a rule which applies only 15% of the time:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of waiting when a random chance of 15 in 100 succeeds: ...</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>If we make a new kind of value, we can also take random values from it, as in the following miniature world:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Weathering&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">A cloud pattern is a kind of value. The cloud patterns are cumulus, altocumulus, cumulonimbus, stratus, cirrus, nimbus, nimbostratus.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">The Mount Pisgah Station is a room. &quot;The rocky peak of Mt. Pisgah (altitude 872m) is graced only by an automatic weather station. The clouds, close enough almost to touch, are [a random cloud pattern]. Temperature: [a random number from 7 to 17] degrees, barometric pressure: [950 + a random number from 0 to 15] millibars.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>The value &quot;a random cloud pattern&quot; produces a random choice from the seven cloud patterns, each equally likely.
