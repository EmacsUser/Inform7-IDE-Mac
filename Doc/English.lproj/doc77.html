<p>
<p>There is pleasantly little to be said about &quot;after&quot; rules. If an action has survived all the rules in its way, and has actually succeeded, then we need to give the player a response which acknowledges this. Inform's normal rules will be sufficient to say something undramatic: for instance, if &quot;taking the napkin&quot; has succeeded then it will reply &quot;Taken.&quot; to the player.
<p>
<p>An after rule is an opportunity to say something more interesting:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After taking the diamonds, say &quot;Taken!&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(Well, slightly more interesting.) After rules automatically end the action (as a success), which is what we would want in the above case. Allowing it to continue would simply result in &quot;Taken.&quot; being printed as well. However, should we really need to do something and then carry on:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After taking the diamonds: say &quot;(Mr Beebe looks up sharply.) &quot;; continue the action.
</font></blockquote><p>
