<p>
<p>When inspiration strikes the player, he can usually be relied upon to make a good-faith effort to communicate the new idea: he will guess the right command. If he guesses wrongly, the mistake is probably the author's, because a good author will try to anticipate all possible wordings and make all of them work.
<p>
<p>Nevertheless it is sometimes good practice to nudge the player towards the right wording - particularly if the player has the right idea but is not explicit enough: for instance, typing TALK TO JUDGE when we really want to know what is to be said (JUDGE, GUILTY); or if the player tries something like PLAY CHESS rather than MOVE PAWN TO KING 4. Similarly, if we make a casual reference such as &quot;In your childhood days, you loved sliding in stocking feet across this hallway&quot;, a player might type SLIDE IN STOCKING FEET: a nice idea, and which deserves a nice response, even though it asks to do something beyond the scope of the game.
<p>
<p>Inform provides a simple mechanism for recognising a command but at the same time recognising that <i>it does not properly specify an action</i>. Such commands are called &quot;mistakes&quot;, for the sake of a memorable term, but the player has not really behaved badly, and should be helped rather than reproved. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;act&quot; as a mistake.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>While that works - the command to &quot;act&quot; is indeed rejected - it is not very good, because no very helpful message is brought up. The following is much better:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;act&quot; as a mistake (&quot;To join the actors, you have to adopt a role in the play! Try PLAY HAMLET or similar.&quot;).
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Or we could once again insist on a given context:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;act&quot; as a mistake (&quot;To join the actors, you have to adopt a role in the play! Try PLAY HAMLET or similar.&quot;) when the location is the Garden Theatre.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>That still has the drawback that the command &quot;act hamlet&quot; will not be recognised: so the final version we want is probably
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;act [text]&quot; as a mistake (&quot;To join the actors, you have to adopt a role in the play! Try PLAY HAMLET or similar.&quot;) when the location is the Garden Theatre.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>since the &quot;[text]&quot; part will soak up any words the player types (or none), meaning that any command at all whose first word is &quot;act&quot; will be matched.
<p>
<p>If we are careful, we can make the reply depend on what was typed in the mistaken command:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;steal [something]&quot; as a mistake (&quot;Just TAKE [the noun] and leave without paying: that's stealing in my book.&quot;).
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The care comes in because Inform applies much less checking to mistakes than to other actions, and odd errors will result if we try to refer to (say) &quot;the second noun&quot; in a command which did not have a second noun.

<p>So far, so good. Now, what if the player tries to GET HOT DISH when the goggles are off? &quot;You can't see any such thing.&quot; doesn't seem like quite the right response: he can see such a thing. He just doesn't know which it is.
<p>
<p>We could go on to write a mistake rule that would scold the player for trying &quot;get [heat] [text]&quot; when not wearing the goggles. The problem is that this would not cover any other phrasing of the command, nor would it account for all the many other things the player might try to do with an object specified by heat.
<p>
<p>What we really want is to catch all instances of the player using the property name when not allowed to do so; and for this purpose we can borrow a trick from the chapter on Activities:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After reading a command:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player wears the goggles, make no decision;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player's command includes &quot;[heat]&quot;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Without the IR goggles on, you cannot tell hot things from cold at sight.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rule succeeds;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Claudia is a woman in the Test Kitchen. &quot;Your assistant Claudia stands by with [list of things carried by Claudia].&quot; The description of Claudia is &quot;Infinitely patient and a very good stenographer.
