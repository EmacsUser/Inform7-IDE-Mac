Supplying a missing noun/second noun</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p><b>1. When it happens.</b> (Two different activities here, but identical except for applying to different nouns.) Suppose that, because of an instruction to Understand something even though it would be lacking a noun - say, 'Understand &quot;take&quot; as taking.' - an incomplete action is generated, one which is required to have a noun, but doesn't. &quot;Supplying a missing noun&quot; takes place to remedy the problem. It can either:
<p>
<p>(i) Set a noun, printing text like &quot;(presumably the black bag)&quot; if it wants, in which case the action goes forward, though it is still subject to the full rules on accessibility exactly as any other action would be; or
<p>
<p>(ii) Make no choice, in which case no action takes place and the player's command is rejected. If the activity printed nothing, Inform will produce a generic reply to the player that &quot;You must supply a noun.&quot;.
<p>
<p><b>2. The default behaviour.</b> In the default grammar for Inform, only three such half-finished actions are ever Understood. One is &quot;going&quot; with no direction, for which this activity simply prints a refusal. The other two are the two undirected senses, &quot;smelling&quot; and &quot;listening&quot;. In each case, the &quot;supplying a missing noun&quot; activity sets the noun to the current location: so, for instance, typing the bare command &quot;listen&quot; might generate the action &quot;listening to the Shoreline&quot;.
<p>
<p><b>3. Examples.</b> (a) This is the definition Inform uses to make &quot;listen&quot; work as outlined above:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for supplying a missing noun while listening (this is the ambient sound rule): change the noun to the location.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(b) It can be elegant to allow second nouns to be dropped with habitual actions, or where the choice is obvious:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('Understand &quot;unlock [something]&quot; as unlocking it with.\n\nRule for supplying a missing second noun while unlocking:\n\tif the skeleton key is carried, change the second noun to the skeleton key;\n\totherwise say &quot;You will have to specify what to unlock [the noun] with.&quot;\n\n\n\n')"><img border=0 src=paste.png></a> Understand &quot;unlock [something]&quot; as unlocking it with.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for supplying a missing second noun while unlocking:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the skeleton key is carried, change the second noun to the skeleton key;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;You will have to specify what to unlock [the noun] with.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
