<p>Relative location can also be important: relative to other people, that is -
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of eating something in the presence of Lady Bracknell, say &quot;Lady Bracknell disapproves thoroughly of gentlemen who snack between meals, and there are few disapprovals in this world quite so thorough as Lady Bracknell's.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>As might be guessed, this applies when the action takes place in the same location as the person named: and of course that person can also be described more vaguely (&quot;... in the presence of a woman&quot;, say), and can just as easily be an inanimate thing (&quot;... in the presence of the radio set&quot;).
<p>
<p>Lady Bracknell is a pushover compared to some matriarchs:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of doing something other than looking, examining or waiting in the presence of the Queen: say &quot;I'm afraid they take what you might call a zero tolerance approach to court etiquette here.&quot;; end the game saying &quot;You have been summarily beheaded&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The last of the optional clauses we can tack on to the description of an action is the most general of all. We can add &quot;when&quot; and then any condition at all, as in:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of eating something when the radio set is switched on, say &quot;Something about the howling short-wave static puts you right off luncheon.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>

<table border=0 bgcolor="#e0e0e0" width=100%><tr><td><font face="lucida grande,geneva,arial,tahoma,verdana,helvetica,helv" size=2><a name="e39"><a href=doc86.html#e39><img border=0 src=../FlipOpen.png></a> <font color="#800000"><b>Example</b> (*).</font> <i>A few notes on "In the presence of" and how it interacts with concealed objects.</i><p>
<p>
<p>Rules about concealment will affect &quot;in the presence of&quot;, too. For instance, suppose we have a man with a pocket pet:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Green Park is a room. The scruffy man is a man in the Park. He wears a trenchcoat. He carries a chihuahua.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for deciding the concealed possessions of someone (called carrier):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the particular possession is the chihuahua and the carrier wears the trenchcoat, yes;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise no.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of eating a hamburger in the presence of the chihuahua:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The chihuahua] yips at you!&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The hamburger is carried by the player. It is edible. Understand &quot;burger&quot; as the hamburger.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Unless we somehow get the trenchcoat away from the scruffy man, the chihuahua will not be in view, and will not intervene in our lunch.
