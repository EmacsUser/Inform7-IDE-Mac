<p>
<p>The range of simulation offered by Inform's model world is intentionally limited to a core of basic essentials. We could argue at the margins, and the choice of what's in and what's out is partly traditional, but most people find the model reasonable as far as it goes.
<p>
<p>A flourishing part of Inform culture since 1993 has been the development of a huge range of &quot;library extensions&quot;, most of which aimed to fill out the model by simulating other aspects of life, too: money, clothing, pourable liquids and the like. None of these extensions was official and all of them were: it was a free-for-all, and in several cases different authors wrote rival extensions to model the same basic ideas. The development of Inform 7 was strongly influenced by the recognition that the base of rules and grammar inside a typical modern game are never written by a single author: they combine the standard Inform material with extensions by several third parties, together with anything specific to the game in question.
<p>
<p>This final chapter discusses how to create extensions.
<p>
<p>Some of the instructions here on how to write an extension are not strictly speaking requirements of Inform, but are &quot;only&quot; stylistic points intended to make the range of extensions easier to work with and contribute to. Extension writers are asked to join in the spirit of the rules and help make the whole cooperative enterprise work harmoniously.
