<p>
<p>Properties can only be given to something if its kind will permit that: we cannot make a chair &quot;dark&quot; or a room &quot;portable&quot;, for instance. When creating kinds, then, we need a way to specify the properties which that kind of thing will allow, and this will need to include new properties of our own devising.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A dead end is either secret or ordinary.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This creates just one new property, not two, as the names are taken as the two states of a single either/or property: secret means not ordinary, ordinary means not secret. Alternatively, we could just say:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A dead end can be secret.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>in which case the opposite of &quot;secret&quot; would be &quot;not secret&quot;.
<p>
<p>Note that we are free to add to the definitions of kinds which already exist, not just those we have created ourselves: for instance,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A room is either indoors or outdoors.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>creates a new property which all rooms either possess or don't. And so on. If we make the above definitions then by default, any dead ends created will be &quot;ordinary&quot; and any rooms created will be &quot;outdoors&quot;: that is, in the absence of other information it is assumed that a new either/or property will not be held. We could reverse this behaviour by adding:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A dead end is usually secret. A room is usually indoors.
</font></blockquote><p>
