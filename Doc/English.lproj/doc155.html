<p>So far, all actions have been carried out by the player: which is fine for exploring the passive world of an empty warehouse, but less good for a drama in which other characters have to be contended with. In fact, an action can be carried out by anybody - by any instance of the &quot;person&quot; kind, that is, which includes all the men, women and animals in the game, and not only the player.
<p>
<p>In interactive fiction, players conventionally ask other characters to do something with commands like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">> will, go west
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Clearly &quot;will, go west&quot; should not produce the same action as &quot;go west&quot;, because a different person will be trying it: this person is called the &quot;actor&quot;, and while the actor is ordinarily the player, here it is the character called Will. Inform distinguishes these two actions like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">going west
<br>asking Will to try going west
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>As a result, we can write rules like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of asking Will to try going west, say &quot;Will scratches his head, baffled by this talk of westward. Is not the ocean without bound?&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>To write rules like this, we sometimes want to generalise about who is supposed to do the deed. To do this we can refer to &quot;person asked&quot;, just as the &quot;noun&quot; stands for whatever noun was typed:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of asking somebody to take something, say &quot;I don't think we ought to tempt [the person asked] into theft, surely?&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>So if the player types &quot;Algy, take sandwich&quot;, the &quot;person asked&quot; would be Algy; the &quot;noun&quot; would be the sandwich; and there would be no &quot;second noun&quot;.
