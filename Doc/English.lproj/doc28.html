<p>
<p>When we write:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">A dead end is usually dark.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>we are saying that it will be dark rather than lighted unless we should specify otherwise. So it would be fine to add:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">The Tortuous Alcove is lighted.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>because although dead ends are usually dark, this one is evidently an exception. On the other hand, if we had originally written
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">A dead end is always dark.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>then Inform would not have permitted any exception to be made, and would have reported a problem if we had tried to make the Tortuous Alcove lighted. Besides &quot;usually&quot; and &quot;always&quot;, we can also employ &quot;seldom&quot; and &quot;never&quot;, which are their negatives. Thus, &quot;never lighted&quot; means the same as &quot;always dark&quot;.
