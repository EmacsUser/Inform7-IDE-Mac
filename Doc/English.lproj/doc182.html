<p>One last way to create a new relation and, in many ways, the easiest of all. If we write:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Contact relates a thing (called X) to a thing (called Y) when X is part of Y or Y is part of X. The verb to be joined to implies the contact relation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>then we would be able to talk about a handle being joined to a door, and a door being joined to a handle, and so on. We are not allowed to declare:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The hook is joined to the line.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>because the question of whether they are joined is not for us to decide: that will be for the condition to determine, whenever we test it. Similarly, we cannot meaningfully write
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">now the hook is joined to the line;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(and Inform will not let us) because this relation is not something we can force either way: we can make it come true by other means, maybe, but we cannot simply make it true by saying so.
<p>
<p>So this way to define relations is, on the face of it, just a sort of verbal trick to write conditions in a more attractive way. The more flexible, changeable relations in previous sections have much greater expressive power. All the same, it is nice to be able to write -
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Nearness relates a room (called A) to a room (called B) when the number of moves from B to A is less than 3. The verb to be near implies the nearness relation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>and then to be able to write rules like:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of listening when the location is near the Sundial: say &quot;You hear a splashing of water.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
