<p>
<p>Ordinarily, if we write
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;manipulate [something]&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>then the &quot;[something]&quot; will only match what is within reach or sight: this is the concept of &quot;scope&quot;, which is what prevents a player from spookily acting on objects from a distance. The parser itself prevents the manipulation rules from ever being invoked on such distant items, which is as it should be.
<p>
<p>Sometimes, though, we positively want to allow this possibility. If we use the special word &quot;any&quot;, as in
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;manipulate [any door]&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>then any door, anywhere in the model world, can be allowed in the player's command. (Of course, the manipulation rules may not do what the player hopes: all that has happened is that the command is now possible to type.) The &quot;any&quot; can be followed by any description of items or rooms, and the latter opens up new possibilities, since rooms are ordinarily never allowed to be named in the player's commands.
<p>
<p>For example, the following gives the player the ability to walk between rooms without giving explicit directions of movement.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Going by name is an action applying to one thing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out going by name: say &quot;You walk to [the noun].&quot;; move the player to the noun.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;go to [any adjacent visited room]&quot; as going by name.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(This is really only a sketch: in a finished work, &quot;go to&quot; would produce helpful errors if non-adjacent but visited rooms were named, and we might also worry about rules applying to movement, because the method above will circumvent them.)

<p>
<p>Suppose we want the player to be able to go after characters who are moving around the map. The trick, of course, is that once characters are gone they are no longer visible to &quot;follow [person]&quot;, so we need &quot;follow [any person]&quot; to find them.
