<p>When several different lines of grammar are supplied to meet the same circumstances, it makes a big difference what order they are tried in. For instance, suppose we have:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;photograph [a door]&quot; as photographing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;photograph [an open door]&quot; as photographing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The second line is more specific than the first, so Inform takes these grammar lines the other way around: it checks for &quot;open door&quot; before it checks for &quot;door&quot;. That didn't matter here, since both lines came out with the same result (the action of photographing), but it matters very much in the next example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;employ [a door]&quot; as opening.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;employ [an open door]&quot; as entering.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>More subtle is a line already seen:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;on/in/inside&quot; or &quot;on top of&quot; as &quot;[within]&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Here Inform puts &quot;on top of&quot; before &quot;on/in/inside&quot;, since otherwise only the &quot;on&quot; of &quot;on top of&quot; will be recognised.
<p>
<p>Mistakes always take precedence over non-mistakes: this is intended to make sure that
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;take umbrage&quot; as a mistake (&quot;Nobody takes umbrage in this game, mister.&quot;).
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>will take precedence over
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;take [something]&quot; as taking.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>even if there is, in fact, a character called Mr Nimbus Umbrage so that the command could conceivably make sense.
