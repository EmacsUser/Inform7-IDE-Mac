<p>When the player has only limited carrying capacity, game play is likely to be tiresome, but we can make life easier by providing a way for the player to carry endless items without dozens of free hands to hold them all:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('&quot;Sackcloth&quot;\n\nThe Attic is a room. The old blue rucksack is a player\'s holdall. The player is wearing the rucksack.\n\nThe carrying capacity of the player is 3.\n\nIn the Attic are a CD entitled No Smoke Without Fire, a 70s photograph of an American winning Wimbledon, a fraxinus branch, an urn holding your late great-aunt\'s remains, a convention badge from the American Society of Hypertension and a ghost story by M R James.\n\n\n')"><img border=0 src=paste.png></a> &quot;Sackcloth&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>

<p>This example game introduces a new kind of container, the &quot;player's holdall&quot;. This is a kind of which most games will contain at most one example, but in principle there can be any number. A player's holdall is a capacious bag into which the player automatically places surplus items whenever his or her hands are full: trying the above example game and getting the items one by one will give the general idea.
<p>
<p>Of course, if the carrying capacity of the player is never reached then there will never be any surplus items and a player's holdall will behave just like any other (portable, usually openable) container.
