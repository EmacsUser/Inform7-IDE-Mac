<p>Similarly, it is forbidden to multiply 122kg and 10kg, not because it could never make sense (a physicist will occasionally multiply two weights) but because the result is - what? Not a number, and not a weight any more. But we are allowed to tell Inform what the result ought to be, and once we have done so, the multiplication will be allowed:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A length is a kind of value. 10m specifies a length. An area is a kind of value. 10 sq m specifies an area.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A length times a length specifies an area.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The balance platform is in the Weighbridge. &quot;The balance platform is 10m by 8m, giving it an area of [10m multiplied by 8m].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>which will turn up as:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The balance platform is 10m by 8m, giving it an area of 80 sq m.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And having told Inform that lengths multiply to area, we could also divide an area by a length to get a length: no further instructions would be needed.
<p>
<p>Note that we are only allowed to make such a rule about multiplication, and only between units, and the result has to be a unit. So this system cannot be used to make Inform multiply, say, a time by a piece of text, nor to contradict any of the standard &quot;dimensional rules&quot; outlined above.
