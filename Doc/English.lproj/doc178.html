<p>
<p>There are still some serious restrictions. Inform has only whole numbers, not floating-point (though we could in principle simulate at least fixed-point numbers by writing something like &quot;10.99kg specifies a weight&quot;). And it only allows numbers from -32768 to 32767. Since a London bus only weighs 7000kg, 32000kg is plenty: on the other hand, if we wanted to measure weight in grammes instead, the limit would be just 32kg, an amount which a human can just about lift.
<p>
<p>The limit also begins to bite when using multiple-number specifications. Internally, Inform stores the above &quot;running time&quot; as a number of seconds, so that 3'59 is actually stored as 239. Calculating the maximum legal running time is a nuisance, so we can instead check the &quot;Kinds&quot; page of the index, where we read that:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><b>running time</b> (<i>plural</i> running times)
<br><i>Written in the following form:</i> 3'59
<br><i>Maximum value allowed:</i> 546'07
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The maximum legal running time is therefore a little over 9 hours, so the new Tori Amos album will not be a problem, but some of the more punishing German operas might break the bank.
<p>
<p>These restrictions are a nuisance, but can normally be managed, and we gain the ability to run the resulting work of IF on a very wide variety of computers indeed, some extremely small.
