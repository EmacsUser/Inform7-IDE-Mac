<p>
<p>Reports of problems, as we have seen, often quote back the source to justify themselves. Rather than quoting actual line numbers (&quot;Midsummer Day, line 2017&quot; or something similar) Inform uses the more user-friendly <img src=../Reveal.tif> icon. The down side of this is that a glance at the list of problems might give little hint of whereabouts in the source the difficulties lie. For this reason, and to help with navigating through large source texts, Inform allows us to subdivide a design using headings.
<p>
<p>A sentence which is the only one in its paragraph and which begins with any of the words &quot;volume&quot;, &quot;book&quot;, &quot;part&quot;, &quot;chapter&quot; or &quot;section&quot; is considered to be a heading or a sub-heading. It is therefore ignored except for purposes of reporting errors, where it is used as follows:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">In Part the First, Chapter 1 - Attic Area:</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080"><b>Problem.</b> You wrote 'South of the Attic is the Winery' <img src=../Reveal.tif>, but in another sentence 'South of the Attic is the Old Furniture' <img src=../Reveal.tif>: this looks like a contradiction, which might be because I have misunderstood what was meant to be the subject of one or both of those sentences.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">In Chapter 2 - Deeper In:</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080"><b>Problem.</b> You wrote 'The Disused Observatory is south of the Dark Room' <img src=../Reveal.tif>, but in another sentence 'South of the Dark Room is the Cupboard' <img src=../Reveal.tif>: again, this looks like a contradiction.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>If the first paragraph of the interactive fiction consists only of a single quoted piece of text, then that's the title of the work. An author can also be given, as follows:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Spellbreaker&quot; by Dave Lebling</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>This completes the groundwork, and we are ready to begin on simulating a world to explore.
