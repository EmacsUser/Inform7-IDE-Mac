<p>
<p>Newly created kinds of value can also be understood, which we make good use of in the example game &quot;Studious&quot;:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Studious&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">The Studio is a room. &quot;The unreal world of the photographic studio, full of fake furniture, cantilevered stands and silver-white shades like miniature parachutes.&quot; The lumpy black camera is in the Studio. &quot;A lumpy black camera hangs from a tripod.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">The rake-thin model is a woman in the Studio. &quot;A rake-thin model, exquisitely bored and boringly exquisite, angles herself indolently.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">Limb is a kind of value. The limbs are left leg, left arm, right leg and right arm.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">Detailing is an action applying to one limb and one visible thing, requiring light. Check detailing: if the camera is not carried then say &quot;You can hardly photograph without a camera, now can you?&quot; instead. Report detailing: say &quot;Click! You take a detail photograph of the [limb understood] of [the second noun].&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;photograph [limb] of [a person]&quot; as detailing.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>Note the way we can refer to the limb mentioned by the player as the &quot;limb understood&quot;. Similarly, we could talk about the &quot;number understood&quot; if the value parsed had been a number, and so on.
