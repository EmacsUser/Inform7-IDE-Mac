<p><b>1. When it happens.</b> Just <i>before</i> writing a paragraph about some item in a room description.
<p>
<p><b>2. The default behaviour.</b> Is to do nothing. However, if a rule is supplied which prints something up, then this replaces the paragraph which would otherwise have been printed. Moreover, any items whose names are said in the course of this rule - for instance, by being listed - are then excluded from the remainder of the room description, because they are considered as having been described sufficiently already.
<p>
<p><b>3. Examples.</b> (a) This is a neat way to wrap several things together into the same paragraph:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('Rule for writing a paragraph about Mr Wickham:\n\tsay &quot;Mr Wickham looks speculatively at [list of women in the location].&quot;\n\n\n')"><img border=0 src=paste.png></a> Rule for writing a paragraph about Mr Wickham:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Mr Wickham looks speculatively at [list of women in the location].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>because now &quot;Mr Wickham looks speculatively at Velma and Daphne&quot; will now prevent the appearance of the subsequent text &quot;You can also see Velma and Daphne.&quot;
