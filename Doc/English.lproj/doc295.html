<p><i>What goes wrong:</i>
<p>
<p>
<p>Elbow Room
<p>Reputed to be the most dangerous bar in the United States; from the outside what it looks like is a virulently purple shack, and from the inside like a badly-lit one. No one is having a knife fight at the moment.
<p>
<p>On the bar are a glass bowl (in which is a selection of pull-tabs) and a shot glass.
<p>
<p>Wallace here looks a little put out.
<p>
<p>You can also see Jake, John, Joe and Jack here.
<p>
<p>>sing
<p>&quot;Could we have some quiet!&quot; says Wallace. And he storms out.
<p>
<p>>g
<p>&quot;Here,&quot; says someone. &quot;I'll buy you all the pull-tabs if you just cut that out.&quot; And they do.
<p>
<p>>g
<p>&quot;I could sing louder?&quot; suggests someone whose name starts with J.
<p>
<p>&quot;No!&quot; roars the crowd.
<p>
<p>>g
<p>&quot;It's no good,&quot; moans someone.
<p>
<p>Whereas I believe those last two responses should be switched.
