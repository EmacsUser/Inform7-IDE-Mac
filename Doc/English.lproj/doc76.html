<p>
<p>We often want to arrange for something to happen at some point in the future. Here is yet another timepiece:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">An egg-timer is in the Chamber. &quot;A plastic egg timer in the shape of a chicken can be pressed to set it going.&quot; Instead of pushing the egg-timer: say &quot;It begins to mark time.&quot;; the egg-timer clucks in four turns from now.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">When the egg-timer clucks: say &quot;Cluck! Cluck! Cluck! says the egg-timer.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>The event here is called &quot;the egg-timer clucks&quot;. It only happens if we instruct so, which we do by writing
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">the egg-timer clucks in four turns from now</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>meaning four turns after the turn in which the egg-timer is pushed. We could alternatively describe this future moment as something like &quot;in 18 minutes from now&quot;, or &quot;at 4:15 PM&quot;.
<p>
<p>If we know in advance what time we want something to happen, we can more simply write:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">At 4 PM: say &quot;The great bells of the clock tower chime four.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>The following more complicated example creates a new phrase which schedules a sequence of events:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">When the penumbra appears: say &quot;The sunlight dies away to an eerie, brownish penumbra.&quot; When the eclipse begins: say &quot;The moon passes across the disc of the sun, plunging the world into darkness.&quot;; change the Chamber to dark. When the eclipse ends: say &quot;The moon passes away from the sun, and a gloomy penumbral light returns.&quot;; change the Chamber to lighted.  When normal sunlight returns: say &quot;The sun shines once more bright in the sky, not to be eclipsed again on this spot for another thirty-seven years.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">To schedule an eclipse for (totality - a time): the penumbra appears at two minutes before totality; the eclipse begins at totality; the eclipse ends at three minutes after totality; normal sunlight returns at five minutes after totality. When play begins, schedule an eclipse for 3:27 PM.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>We shall see much more about creating phrases later.
