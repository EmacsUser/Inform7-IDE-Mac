<p>Understand ... when ... does not allow callings as yet, so the following fails and perhaps should work:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand the tone property as describing a letter (called the subject) when we have examined the subject.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Disambiguation is currently problematic, in the sense that there is no equivalent for some of the control provided in I6 by ChooseObjects. It would just be nice to be able to convey to the parser which objects to prefer under what circumstances: prefer edible things when eating, etc. Can at present add
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;eat [edible thing]&quot; as eating.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>which does force preference of edible objects; but this breaks the &quot;held&quot; requirement. Besides, it'd be neat to be able to make more complicated instructions about what to prefer.[ES]
<p>
<p>Also, I would not mind, though I realize this may be heinous, if there were a disambiguation activity, so that I could write &quot;Rule for printing the name of something while disambiguating...&quot; or whatever. [ES]
