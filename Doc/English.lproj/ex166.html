<p>
<p><b>1. When it happens.</b> Whenever the name of a thing or room is printed.
<p>
<p><b>2. The default behaviour.</b> Its &quot;printed name&quot; property is printed out.
<p>
<p><b>3. Examples.</b> (a) A pen which is described differently in inventories:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for printing the name of the pen while taking inventory: say &quot;useful pen&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Taking inventory&quot; is a condition which is true if that's the current action and not otherwise, so the effect is that the pen is called &quot;a useful pen&quot; only in inventory listings. &quot;While looking&quot; is a similarly useful one.
<p>
<p>(b) Italicising the names of novels:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A novel is a kind of thing. Dr Zhivago and Persuasion are novels. Before printing the name of a novel, say &quot;[italic type]&quot;. After printing the name of a novel, say &quot;[roman type]&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(c) Telling the time:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After printing the name of the wrist watch while taking inventory: say &quot; (time: [the time of day])&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(d) Merging containers with their contents:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('Rule for printing the name of the bottle while not inserting or removing:\n\tif the bottle contains sand, say &quot;bottle of sand&quot;;\n\totherwise say &quot;empty bottle&quot;;\n\tomit contents in listing.\n\n\n')"><img border=0 src=paste.png></a> Rule for printing the name of the bottle while not inserting or removing:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the bottle contains sand, say &quot;bottle of sand&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;empty bottle&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;omit contents in listing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The special phrase &quot;omit contents in listing&quot; means that any inventory list, room description, etc., will simply list &quot;a bottle of sand&quot; or &quot;an empty bottle&quot;, rather than &quot;a bottle (in which is sand)&quot; or &quot;a bottle (which is empty)&quot;. The clause about not inserting or removing is to prevent messages like &quot;You put the sand in the bottle of sand.&quot;, where it's confusing to refer to the bottle as anything other than &quot;the bottle&quot;.
