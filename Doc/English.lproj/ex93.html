<p><b>1. When it happens.</b> Only when a group of identical items is present in the same place, and are being described jointly with text like &quot;You can see five gold rings here.&quot; The action happens after &quot;five&quot; and before &quot;here.&quot;
<p>
<p><b>2. The default behaviour.</b> The plural name - in this case &quot;gold rings&quot; - is printed out.
<p>
<p><b>3. Examples.</b> See below.

<p>
<p>That last &quot;repeat&quot; is merely a device to shuffle the order of items in the satchel so that the player will not always encounter the letters in a neatly presorted order, despite our defining them that way.
