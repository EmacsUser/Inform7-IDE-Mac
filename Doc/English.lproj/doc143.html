<p>The following are all valid phrases:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">award 2 points
<br>award 8 points
<br>award 30 points
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>but they do not of course have different definitions. Instead, a single definition (internal to Inform, since &quot;award ... points&quot; comes built in) covers these and all similar cases, like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To award (some - a number) points: ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This is a &quot;pattern&quot;: it matches the text &quot;award 4 points&quot;, and indeed &quot;award four points&quot;, but not
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">award &quot;blue cheese&quot; points;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>which results in the following error:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><b>Problem.</b> You wrote 'award &quot;blue cheese&quot; points' <img src=../Reveal.tif>, but '&quot;blue cheese&quot;' seems to be some text, whereas I was expecting to find a number there.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The number does not need to be a literal constant such as 52, but can be anything which works out to be a number: the name of a number variable, for instance.
<p>
<p>The term &quot;(some - a number)&quot; tells Inform that a value is expected here, and also tells it the kind of that value (&quot;number&quot;) and what to call this value (&quot;some&quot;). That name is then used in the rest of the definition, whenever the actual number of points is needed. A second example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To slam shut (box - an open container): say &quot;With great panache, you slam shut [the box].&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Which would not match, for instance, this:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">slam shut the black door;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>because the black door is not an open container.
