<p>
<p>Another useful adjective built into Inform is &quot;adjacent&quot;. Two rooms are said to be adjacent if there is a map connection between them which does not pass through some barrier such as a door. This is easily tested:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the Hallway is adjacent to the Study ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We usually want to know about the places adjacent to the current scene of the action, so that is what the adjective &quot;adjacent&quot; means when applied to rooms. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if somebody is in an adjacent room, ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>As with the case of &quot;visible&quot;, the adjective is a cut-down version of the more general relationship. This often happens: &quot;worn&quot; and &quot;carried&quot;, for instance, imply &quot;by the player&quot; unless something else is specified.
<p>
<a name="e1"><a href=doc67.html#e1><img border=0 src=../FlipOpen.png></a> <font color="#800000"><b>Example</b> (*).</font> <i>A person who moves randomly between rooms of the map.</i><p>
<p>
<p>Suppose we want a restless sort of character always pacing from room to room. It is quite easy to use adjacency to achieve this effect:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Mistress of Animals&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Forest Pool is a room. The Mountainside is south of the Forest Pool. The Road is west of the Forest Pool. The Town is west of the Road.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Artemis is a woman in the Forest Pool.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if Artemis is in a room (called the current location)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let next location be a random room which is adjacent to the current location;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if Artemis is visible, say &quot;Artemis heads to [the next location].&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move Artemis to next location;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if Artemis is visible, say &quot;Artemis arrives from [the current location].&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Of course, it helps that Artemis is the sort to like open spaces. The implementation would become more complicated if there were doors which might block transit between these locations.
