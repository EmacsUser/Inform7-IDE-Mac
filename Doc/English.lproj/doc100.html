<p>We have now seen how to change the properties of rooms and things, and also any freestanding values which may have a bearing on the model world. We are not allowed to change the kind of anything during play. Our remaining freedom is to move things around. It would make no sense to move rooms around, because rooms are the fixed reference points in our geography, but anything else is mobile. This even includes things which are supposedly &quot;fixed in place&quot;, for unlike the player, we have god-like powers. (There is one restriction: backdrops, which are present in more than one place at once, can only be moved to regions. And while it is legal to move a door, it is not a good idea.)
<p>
<p>Here is how to move something:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">move the genie's lamp to Aladdin's Cave
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The first object named has to be a thing; the destination can be a room, as here, or another object - this will usually need to be a container, a supporter or a person, since Inform understands what it would mean for these to have contents, but there is no absolute restriction. If the item is moved to a person, then it will be carried rather than worn.
<p>
<p>When something is moved, all its contents (and all their contents, and so on) move with it.
