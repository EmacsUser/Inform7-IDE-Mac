<p>
<p>We have already seen &quot;[something]&quot; and &quot;[someone]&quot;, which are standard examples of &quot;tokens of grammar&quot; - patterns matched by suitable named things. There are several other standard tokens, provided not so much from necessity but to allow the game parser to be more graceful and responsive. &quot;[someone]&quot; matches the same possibilities as &quot;[a person]&quot; would, but the parser handles it a little better in cases of failure. These special tokens are best explained by looking at some of the examples in the standard grammar, which can be browsed in the Index of any game.
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;wear [something held]&quot; as wearing.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>The named item must be held by the player, but the game will automatically pick it up if necessary, minimising nuisance.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;take [things]&quot; as taking.
<br>Understand &quot;drop [things held]&quot; as dropping.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>&quot;[things]&quot; is like &quot;[something]&quot; but allows a list of items, or a vague plural like &quot;all&quot;, to be typed. The result will be a sequence of actions, one for each item thus described. &quot;[things held]&quot; is the analogous token for &quot;[something held]&quot;.
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;take [things inside] from [something]&quot; as removing.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>&quot;[things inside]&quot; matches only what is inside the second-named thing, and ensures that (for instance) the command &quot;take all from box&quot; does not also try to take the box.
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;put [other things] in/inside/into [something]&quot; as inserting it into.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>Similarly, &quot;[other things]&quot; will allow anything except the second-named thing.
<p>(Like &quot;[things inside]&quot; it is really only needed for handling containers.)
