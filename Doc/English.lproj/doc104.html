<p>
<p>Inform keeps track of the time of day automatically: play ordinarily begins at 9 AM and each turn takes one minute. In some works of interactive fiction, time of day is crucial: in others, it is irrelevant or even, by a sort of tacit convention, non-existent. So Inform does nothing to act upon the time, or to reveal it to the player, without instruction. Nevertheless it is there.
<p>
<p>A sentence like the following allows the initial time to be set up as something other than 9 AM:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">The time of day is 3:13 PM.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>Here, &quot;3:13 PM&quot; is a constant value of a kind not seen before: it's a kind of value called &quot;time&quot;, and the value &quot;time of day&quot; is a time that varies. After one turn it will be 3:14 PM, then 3:15 PM and so on.
<p>
<p>Note that the sentence above is an assertion (a statement about the initial state of affairs), not an instruction which can be part of a rule. It would be equivalent to write:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">When play begins, change the time of day to 3:13 PM.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>We more often use &quot;change the time of day to ...&quot; to take care of drastic events:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When the player loses consciousness:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;change the time of day to 10:12 AM;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;A mist comes over your vision, and when you come to, it is morning and you are in bed.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
