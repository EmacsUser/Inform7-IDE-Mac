<p>
<p>All activities start, continue for a while and then finish: however, no activity ever runs on for more than a single turn. Several activities can be going on at the same time. For instance, suppose the following is printed as part of the description of a grocery:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">You can see a banana, an apple and a star-fruit here.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>At the moment when Inform prints &quot;apple&quot;, two activities are under way: &quot;listing contents of the Grocery&quot;, and &quot;printing the name of the apple&quot;. The sequence of events was in fact:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">say &quot;You can see &quot;
<br>start listing contents of the Grocery
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;a &quot;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;start printing the name of the banana
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;banana&quot;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;finish printing the name of the banana
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;, an &quot;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;start printing the name of the apple
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;apple&quot;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;finish printing the name of the apple
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot; and a &quot;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;start printing the name of the star-fruit
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;star-fruit&quot;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;finish printing the name of the star-fruit
<br>finish listing contents of the Grocery
<br>say &quot; here.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The golden rule is: if activity B starts during activity A, it must also finish during activity A.
