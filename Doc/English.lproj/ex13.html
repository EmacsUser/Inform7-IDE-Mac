<p>
<p>If we want to impose the restriction about carrying the camera on everyone, we need a rule like the following:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Check someone trying photographing: if the person asked does not carry the camera, stop the action.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Implicitly, that &quot;someone&quot; excludes the player. Note that we say nothing in this rule, stopping the action without a word: after all, Clark might well be out of sight when trying this. If he is within sight, then we read:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">>clark, photograph me
<br>Clark Gable is unable to do that.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We saw before that Inform's built-in rules all have handy names (the &quot;can't drop what's already dropped rule&quot;, and such), and that these are useful when writing better &quot;unable to...&quot; messages. So for a deluxe version, we end up with:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Check someone trying photographing (this is the other people can't photograph without the camera rule): if the person asked does not carry the camera, stop the action.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And now, with ACTIONS on, we find that:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">>clark, photograph me
<br>[asking Clark Gable to try photographing yourself]
<br>[(1) Clark Gable trying photographing yourself]
<br>[(1) Clark Gable trying photographing yourself - failed the other people can't photograph without the camera rule]
<br>Clark Gable is unable to do that.
<br>[asking Clark Gable to try photographing yourself - succeeded]
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>which means that we could have, say,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Unsuccessful attempt by Clark trying photographing:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the reason the action failed is the other people can't photograph without the camera rule, say &quot;Clark is too suave to be embarrassed. 'Frankly, my dear, I don't have a camera.'&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;Clark tries, and fails, to take a photograph.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>

<p>By default, if we make no modifications, telling one player to give something to another will fail, even if persuasion succeeds. This is because the default behavior of the GIVE command is interrupted by the &quot;block giving rule&quot; -- since in many cases we do not want people to exchange objects freely.
<p>
<p>However, suppose that we do want characters to be able to exchange articles freely: we allow persuasion to succeed and turn off the &quot;block giving rule&quot;.
