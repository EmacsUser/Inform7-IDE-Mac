<p>
<p>Creating a new rulebook is also straightforward, as we see in the following modest example game:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('&quot;Appraisal&quot;\n\nThe Passage is east of the Tomb. The green-eyed idol is in the Tomb. A Speak-Your-Progress machine is in the Passage.\n\nAppraisal rules is a rulebook.\n\nAn appraisal rule: say &quot;Click... whirr... the score is [the score in words] points.&quot;\n\nAn appraisal rule: if we have taken the idol then say &quot;Most importantly of all, the idol has been found.&quot;\n\nInstead of switching on the machine, follow the appraisal rules.\n\n\n')"><img border=0 src=paste.png></a> &quot;Appraisal&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Passage is east of the Tomb. The green-eyed idol is in the Tomb. A Speak-Your-Progress machine is in the Passage.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Appraisal rules is a rulebook.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">An appraisal rule: say &quot;Click... whirr... the score is [the score in words] points.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">An appraisal rule: if we have taken the idol then say &quot;Most importantly of all, the idol has been found.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of switching on the machine, follow the appraisal rules.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The creation of the rulebook is all very well, but without the final sentence it would never be used. The crucial new phrase here is &quot;follow ...&quot;, which is the first of several phrases allowing us to use rules whenever we want to (rather than simply at predetermined times such as when a particular action is being tried, or at the end of every turn, and such).
<p>
<p>Like &quot;number&quot; or &quot;text&quot;, &quot;rule&quot; and &quot;rulebook&quot; are kinds of value built into Inform: &quot;the blossom rule&quot; is a value whose kind is &quot;rule&quot;, whereas &quot;the every turn rules&quot; is a value whose kind is &quot;rulebook&quot;. In fact, Inform considers a rulebook to be a special case of a rule, so that whenever a rule is required it is legal to name a rulebook instead, but not vice versa. The &quot;follow&quot; phrase here...
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of switching on the machine, follow the appraisal rules.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>...expects to be applied to a value of kind &quot;rule&quot;; &quot;the appraisal rules&quot; is in fact a rulebook, but since that counts as a rule the phrase makes sense to Inform. To follow a rulebook means to run through all its rules in turn; to follow a single rule means just that one, of course.

<blockquote><font color="#000080">The trapdoor is up of the Library and east of the Plaza. The trapdoor is a door. It is flammable, closed, lockable, and locked. &quot;A trapdoor in the ceiling is your only hope of escape[if flaming]. Fortunately, it is rapidly burning through[end if].&quot; The trapdoor has endurance 15.

<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of going through the closed trapdoor, say &quot;[The trapdoor] is closed.&quot;

<p>We can then add a special fire rule to handle the trapdoor, which will be called as part of the same sequence. Again, this would be most important if the fire rules were part of a standard extension, and the trapdoor fire rule the author's own addition.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A fire rule:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the trapdoor is flaming and a random chance of 1 in 3 succeeds
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let the caught thing be a random flammable whole thing which can be touched by the trapdoor;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the caught thing is a thing
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;A spark from [the trapdoor] catches [the caught thing]!&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the caught thing is flaming;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of going to the Plaza:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Out at last!&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end the game in victory.
