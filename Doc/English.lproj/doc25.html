<p>
<p>We have seen how to place objects in rooms, and in containers or on supporters, but not how to make them begin in the player's possession, which we do as follows:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">A brass lantern and an old brass key are initially carried.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>Clothes are simply things which have the either/or property of being &quot;wearable&quot;: if something has this property then the player will be allowed to wear it, provided it can first be picked up. It will then have the either/or property of being &quot;worn&quot;. To start the player off wearing something, we need to specify both that the player has it and that the player wears it:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">The cardinal's hat is initially carried. The hat is worn.</font></blockquote>
