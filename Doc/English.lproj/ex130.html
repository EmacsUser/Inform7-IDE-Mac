<p>Writing in new rows is simple:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">choose a blank row in Table 3;
<br>change element entry to &quot;Fluorine&quot;;
<br>change symbol to &quot;F&quot;;
<br>change atomic number to 9;
<br>change atomic weight to 19;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This will produce an error if there are no blank rows left in Table 3, so it can be important to worry about free space. To that end we can not only find the number of rows (as we have already seen) but also the number currently blank and not blank. Thus these:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">the number of blank rows in Table 3
<br>the number of filled rows in Table 3
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>always add up to &quot;the number of rows in Table 3&quot;.
<p>
<p>To delete a row, we first choose it and then &quot;blank out the whole row&quot;. Thus, for abdication purposes:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">choose row with name of &quot;Edward VIII&quot; in the Table of Recent Monarchs;
<br>blank out the whole row;
</font></blockquote><p>
