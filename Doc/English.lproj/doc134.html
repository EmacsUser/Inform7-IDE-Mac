<p>We can now gather the material so far into a working drama:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Age of Steam&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Station is a room. &quot;Eynforme Halt is a raised platform fringed with cowslip: a whistle-stop with no more than a signal and a water-tank.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Flying Scotsman is fixed in place. &quot;The Flying Scotsman, fastest train in the world, is now at a dead standstill.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Train Stop is a scene. Train Stop begins when the player is in the Station for the third turn. Train Stop ends when the time since Train Stop began is 3 minutes.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When Train Stop begins:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move the Flying Scotsman to the Station;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;The Flying Scotsman pulls up at the platform, to a billow of steam and hammering.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When Train Stop ends:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remove the Flying Scotsman from play;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;The Flying Scotsman inches away, with a squeal of released brakes, gathering speed invincibly until it disappears around the hill. All is abruptly still once more.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Note the useful value &quot;time since Train Stop began&quot;. (This only makes sense if the scene has begun, of course.) The actual time, in case it is needed, can also be obtained:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of entering the Flying Scotsman, say &quot;Alas, the [time when Train Stop began] arrival is only to take on water, not to set down or pick up.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
