<p>Though there are more than a hundred example texts in the main text of the documentation, few of them are plausible as playable works of interactive fiction. So they perhaps do not give a very good idea of what practical use of Inform would involve. Successful writing of IF involves orchestrating a whole range of techniques and effects, some literary, some technical, and to get the best from Inform certainly involves using the material in all of the chapters of this documentation at once.
<p>
<p>The examples in this Appendix, which are much longer than those which have gone before, are intended to show how Inform's different mechanisms can be combined to produce works of more or less finished quality. We also intend them as examples of style, or at least of one idea of style, and have tried to add notes which are reasonably honest about why we have chosen one method over another, and what turned out to work badly - rather than pretending that Inform is so sublime that the creative process is effortless.
