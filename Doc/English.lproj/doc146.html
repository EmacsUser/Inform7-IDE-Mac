<p>
<p>Returning to the apple blossom, and stretching a point seasonally,
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn, say &quot;The summer breeze shakes the apple-blossom.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>This rule is nameless. It needs no name because it will never need to be referred to: by identifying it as an every turn rule we have already said enough to lodge it in the &quot;every turn rules&quot; rulebook. In fact, though, it is easy to create a named rule:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">This is the blossom rule: say &quot;The summer breeze shakes the apple-blossom.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>The name of a rule must always end with the word &quot;rule&quot;, for clarity's sake. (The phrasing &quot;This is the ... rule&quot; is used because &quot;The ... rule&quot; would be open to misinterpretation.)
<p>
<p>The rule now exists, but belongs to no rulebook, and will never be applied unless explicitly invoked, or unless explicitly placed into a rulebook after all:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">The blossom rule is listed in the every turn rules.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>A single rule like this can be listed in any number of rulebooks, including none.
<p>
<p>Alternatively, it is possible to both name and list a rule in a single sentence:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn (this is the blossom rule): say &quot;The summer breeze shakes the apple-blossom.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>Where rules have been named, we are able (as promised) to have a say in what order they come in:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">The blossom rule is listed before the moving doorways rule in the every turn rules.</font></blockquote>
