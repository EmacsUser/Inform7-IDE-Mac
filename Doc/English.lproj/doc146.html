<p>
<p>A basic mechanism for documenting extensions is built into Inform. For simple extensions, this will probably do instead of a manual; for more complex ones, it should still prove a useful supplement to one.
<p>
<p>As soon as a game has successfully been translated, its index is brought up to date: pages of the index record all the kinds and what they are for, all the phrases which can be used, and so on. Any kind or phrase created in an extension is automatically included. In order for the kind to be described more helpfully, we should write a sentence like so:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">The specification of player's holdall is &quot;Represents a container which the player can carry around as a sort of rucksack, into which spare items are automatically stowed away.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>There is no need to specify the properties which apply: that is all done automatically. (&quot;Specification&quot; is a sort of pseudo-property which only kinds have, and it's used just for this.)
