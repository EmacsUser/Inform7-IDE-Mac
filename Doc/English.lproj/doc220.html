<p>So far we have seen rules which apply to actions, and rules which do not apply to anything specific - &quot;every turn&quot; rules, for instance. We can also have rules which apply to a specific object.
<p>
<p>An example of rules applying to given objects is provided by the way that Inform decides whether the player can reach something or not. For instance, suppose the following:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Laboratory is a room. In the Laboratory is a conical flask. The flask is closed and transparent. In the flask is an antibumping granule.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The player will be able to examine the granule but not to take it, as that would require reaching through glass. Internally, what happens if the player tries to take the granule is this: a rulebook called the &quot;reaching inside rules&quot; is applied to the conical flask. This normally contains the following three rules:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">the can't reach inside closed containers rule
<br>the can't take people's possessions rule
<br>the can't take component parts rule
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Two of these rules apply only to actions of taking and removing: if the player only wants to push the granule, for instance, only the &quot;can't reach inside closed containers&quot; rule is applicable. This is the gist of it:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The can't reach inside closed containers rule: if the object in question is a closed container begin; say &quot;[The object in question] is closed!&quot;; deny access; end if.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>In such a rule the &quot;object in question&quot; is the object to which the rule is being applied. Note that a reaching inside rule can &quot;deny access&quot; (stopping with fail), or &quot;allow access&quot; (stopping with success), or neither, in which case the decision is left up to any subsequent rules in the rulebook to make. If none of them decide, access is allowed.
