<p>
<p>A useful little phrase allows us to trigger off actions ourselves, rather than waiting for the player to type something which generates them. Thus:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of entering the trapdoor, try going up.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>The effect of this is that the original action is stopped and converted into a new one. The word &quot;try&quot; is chosen to make clear that there is no guarantee of success. For example:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">Before locking the front door, try closing the front door.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>&quot;Try&quot; can be modified with the word &quot;silently&quot; thus:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">try silently taking the napkin;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>Silence is maintained only if this new action, the taking of the napkin, is successful: otherwise a suitable objection will be voiced. The following:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">Before locking the front door, try silently closing the front door.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>is better than our previous attempt because the closing action is meant to be something that the player would do quite unconsciously, so that it seems inappropriate to mention it at all.
