<p>
<p>Most of the rules built into Inform are malleable, and so that they can be referred to, they have names. For instance, a rule called &quot;the advance time rule&quot; is the one which increments the number of turns - usually visible on the &quot;status line&quot; displayed above the window of a game in progress - and advances the clock, which is usually not visible, but ticking away behind the scenes.
<p>
<p>A rulebook is a list of rules to be followed in sequence. It is a rulebook called &quot;the turn sequence&quot; that contains all of the end-of-turn operations, each in its own named rule. The advance time rule is one of these; another tells Inform to run through the every turn rules. For convenience, the following names are synonymous:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">advance time = the advance time rule
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">the turn sequence rules = turn sequence rulebook = turn sequence = the turn sequence
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Whereas &quot;the turn sequence rule&quot; (singular) is not allowed, as it would suggest that the rulebook is constrained to have room for only one rule, which is not true.
<p>
<p>The names of built-in rules have been chosen as descriptively as possible: the &quot;can't go through closed doors rule&quot;, for instance. We have already seen some of these names used in the Advanced Actions chapter, and will later use them like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">ignore the can't go through closed doors rule;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Names for rules tend to be verbose, but this is a situation where clarity is very much better than brevity.
