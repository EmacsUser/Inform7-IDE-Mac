<p><b>1. When it happens.</b> When looking in darkness.
<p>
<p><b>2. The default behaviour.</b> To print &quot;It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.&quot;
<p>
<p><b>3. Examples.</b> (a) A simple variation of wording:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for printing the description of a dark room: say &quot;Your eyes can barely make anything out.&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(b) More stylishly,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for printing the description of a dark room: try listening instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>which produces, for instance,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Darkness
<br>You hear nothing unexpected.
</font></blockquote><p>
