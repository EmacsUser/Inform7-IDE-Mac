<p>Our three example actions can be recognised in play using the following:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;photograph [something]&quot; as photographing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;blink&quot; as blinking.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;scrape [something] with [something]&quot; as scraping.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The last of these examples shows why Inform does not risk generating this automatically: English is so full of irregular verbs. Inform could have guessed &quot;blink&quot; and &quot;photograph&quot;, but might then have opted for &quot;scrap&quot; instead of &quot;scrape&quot;.
<p>
<p>Inform does risk automatically generating the past participle of an action (many past participles are never needed, so the stakes are lower if Inform gets this wrong). What almost always happens is that the &quot;-ing&quot; is replaced with &quot;-ed&quot;, which happens to be correct in these three cases: photographed, blinked, scraped. It would be disastrously wrong for something like taking, though: we need taken, not taked. We can get around this like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Weaving is an action with past participle woven, applying to one thing.
</font></blockquote><p>

<p>Because the can of root beer should have some reactions to having been shaken later in the game, we need to borrow a few ideas from the later chapters on time:

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the can calms down in five turns from now;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You give the can a good hard shake.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;change the can to agitated.

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of listening to the can: say &quot;It sounds [if agitated]fizzy[otherwise]calm[end if]!&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When the can calms down:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;change the can to calm.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The sticky mess is fixed in place. &quot;There is a sticky mess on the ground.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of opening the agitated can of root beer:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remove the can of root beer from play;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the sticky mess is in the location;
