<p>The &quot;photographing&quot; action now works very nicely when the player does it. But not when others try. Suppose that neither the player, not Clark Gable, is holding the camera:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">>photograph clark
<br>You can hardly photograph without a camera, now can you?
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">>clark, photograph me
<br>>
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>An uncanny silence. What has happened is that the rules written so far are all implicitly restricted to the player only. This is because when we write -
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Check photographing: if the camera is not carried then say &quot;You can hardly photograph without a camera, now can you?&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>the action is &quot;photographing&quot;, not &quot;Clark trying photographing&quot;. In the next few sections we shall see how to make the rules work nicely for everybody. This is a little bit harder, so it should be noted right away that in many projects there is no need. In a game which has no other characters who succumb to persuasion, for instance, only the player will ever try the action.

<p>
<p>It will sometimes be handy to write actions that are only available to the non-player characters and not to the player. To do this, we just define an action which has no &quot;understand&quot;: the player will never be able to specify this command himself, but other characters can try it.
<p>
<p>This is particularly useful for creating abstract or general actions for when we want a character to eat something, wear something, or go somewhere, but aren't too particular as to what the object is; as here, where we just want Clark to move away from the kryptonite, regardless of direction:
