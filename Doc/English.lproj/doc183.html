<p>
<p>Most of the openly declared relations in Inform are between things - people, for instance, or rooms - but beneath the surface, many relations also apply to values. For instance,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the turn count is less than 100, ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>involves a relation between two numbers expressed by the verb &quot;to be less than&quot;. These can also be created easily, provided we are willing to supply a definition. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Material is a kind of value. The materials are wood and metal. A thing has a material.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Materiality relates a thing (called X) to a material (called Y) when Y is the material of X. The verb to be made of implies the materiality relation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Of course, this does no more than to wrap up a property in the language of relations, but that does give us the elegant wording
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the cube is made of wood, ...
<br>say &quot;The carpenter looks at [the list of things which are made of wood].&quot;;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>as an alternative to:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the cube is wood, ...
<br>say &quot;The carpenter looks at [the list of things which are wood].&quot;;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>By writing a more interesting definition, we get a more interesting relation as a result, of course. Here is a mathematical one:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Divisibility relates a number (called N) to a number (called M) when remainder after dividing M by N is 0. The verb to divide (it divides, they divide, it divided, it is divisible) implies the divisibility relation. The verb to be a factor of implies the divisibility relation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We now find that &quot;2 divides 12&quot;, &quot;5 is not a factor of 12&quot; and &quot;12 is divisible by 3&quot; are all true. Again, we are only really gaining a nice form of words, but improving the clarity of the source text is never a bad thing.
