<p><b>1. When it happens.</b> When parsing a command such as &quot;take all&quot;, where the player uses &quot;all&quot; to signify everything within reach.
<p>
<p><b>2. The default behaviour.</b> The actual method used is complicated, as &quot;all&quot; is not as simple as it seems - &quot;take all&quot; would not include the player's own body, for instance, or the crescent moon. The point of this action is to allow the normal method to be changed for given objects, or given kinds of object.
<p>
<p><b>3. Examples.</b> (a) Removing scenery from &quot;all&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for deciding whether all includes scenery: it does not.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The phrases &quot;it does&quot; and &quot;it does not&quot; make a decision.
<p>
<p>(b) Ensuring that a given thing, which might otherwise be excluded, is included:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for deciding whether all includes the oval roof: it does.
</font></blockquote><p>
