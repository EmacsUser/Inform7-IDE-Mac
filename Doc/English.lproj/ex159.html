<p>There is no difficulty about entirely blank rows: or rather, the only difficulty is once again that they are boring to type out. We can avoid the necessity by appending &quot;with ... blank rows&quot; at the foot of the table:

<p>(These words cannot be placed in between rows, but only at the bottom.) And indeed the table can start out completely empty:

<p>
<p>Blank rows are useful because they enable us to add new data to a table. In effect, they are invisible when not used. A repeat loop like
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">repeat through Table 3 begin; ...; end repeat
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>automatically skips blank rows, so it would initially do nothing at all. Similarly, choosing a &quot;random&quot; row will never choose a blank one.
