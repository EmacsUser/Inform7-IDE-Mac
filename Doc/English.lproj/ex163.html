Adjacent rooms and routes through the map</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>Another useful adjective built into Inform is &quot;adjacent&quot;. Two rooms are said to be adjacent if there is a map connection between them which does not pass through some barrier such as a door. This is easily tested:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the Hallway is adjacent to the Study ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We usually want to know about the places adjacent to the current scene of the action, so that is what the adjective &quot;adjacent&quot; means when applied to rooms. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if somebody is in an adjacent room, ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>As with the case of &quot;visible&quot;, the adjective is a cut-down version of the more general relationship. This often happens: &quot;worn&quot; and &quot;carried&quot;, for instance, imply &quot;by the player&quot; unless something else is specified.
<p>
<p>While on the subject of navigating the map, the phrase &quot;the best route from A to B&quot; gives the direction to take in order to get from A to B by the shortest number of movements between rooms - if there is any way through at all. For example, here is a lure:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The description of the brass compass is &quot;The dial points quiveringly to [best route from the location to the Lodestone Room].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Best routes are ordinarily forbidden to go through doors, but if the suffix &quot;using doors&quot; is added as an option then any open or openable and unlocked door may be used on the way; and if &quot;using even locked doors&quot; is given, then any door at all will do. Since magnetism is no respecter of property, that seems right here:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The description of the brass compass is &quot;The dial points quiveringly to [best route from the location to the Lodestone Room, using even locked doors].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The phrase &quot;the best route from A to B&quot; gives the direction to take next, if we are at A and want to end up at B. Suppose this is east. We can find out where we go next by looking up &quot;the room east from A&quot;: similarly for any other direction, of course. (This can see through any doors, locked or not.)
<p>
<p>Finally, we can also stipulate that only certain rooms may be used for the journey, as in the following example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">best route from the Drawbridge to the Keep through visited rooms
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The condition - in this case, that &quot;visited rooms&quot; must be used - also applies to both ends of the journey. (Also, saying something like &quot;...through containers&quot; would mean there is never a route, since it is only rooms which appear on the map.)
<p>
<p>We can also find out how long the journey would be:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The description of the proximity gadget is &quot;You are now [number of moves from the location to the Sundial] moves from the Sundial.&quot;;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This number is, of course, 0 if the location is already the Sundial. If there is no way at all to get to the Sundial, the number is -1.

<p>
<p>The following rule appends a paragraph to every room description. We need not worry about doors (despite the pass in the Bernese Oberland known figuratively as the &quot;Little Door&quot;).
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('After looking:\n\tsay &quot;Yellow arms on the signpost point:-[line break]&quot;;\n\trepeat with destination running through rooms begin;\n\t\tlet the way be the best route from the location to the destination;\n\t\tif the way is a direction, say &quot;  [way] for [the destination]: [number of moves from the location to the destination] Std.&quot;;\n\tend repeat.\n\n\n')"><img border=0 src=paste.png></a> After looking:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Yellow arms on the signpost point:-[line break]&quot;;

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the way is a direction, say &quot;  [way] for [the destination]: [number of moves from the location to the destination] Std.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end repeat.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The result might be:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Hotel Stechelberg
<br>The wooden hiking inn at the end of the road, with flowerboxes, canton flags, outdoor tables and a triangular paddock for the cows contesting the annual Miss Stechelberg competition. Otto and Marianne do cheerful innkeeper things, while the sun blazes from a gentian-blue sky.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Yellow arms on the signpost point:-
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;north for Lauterbrunnen: 2 Std.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;west for Sefinental: 2 Std.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;west for Schilthorn: 6 Std.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;southeast for Trachsellauenen: 1 Std.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;southeast for Oberhornsee: 3 Std.
