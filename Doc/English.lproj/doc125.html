<p>Carrying out easy calculations with times is straightforward:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The chronometer is in the Clock Chamber. &quot;On one wall is a terribly self-important chronometer showing the time in major world cities. London: [time of day]. Paris: [one hour after the time of day]. Tokyo: [9 hours after the time of day]. Cupertino, California: [7 hours before the time of day].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The phrase &quot;9 hours after the time of day&quot; takes the time of day and adds 9 hours, but this is not the same as ordinary addition of numbers: 9 hours after 11 AM is 8 PM. (This is why we don't use the symbols &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot; when adding times: it would be confusing to the reader.) Similarly, we have conditions
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the time of day is before 10:45 AM then ...
<br>Instead of waiting when the time of day is after 4:00 PM: ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>for putting times in order. In recognition of the fact that very few games begin before 4 AM, whereas many run on past midnight, the start of the day is taken to be 4 AM: thus 3:59 AM is after 11:10 PM, but 4:04 AM is before it. Almost all comparisons of time involve the time of day, so we allow the following abbreviations:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if it is before 10:45 AM then ...
<br>Instead of waiting when it is after 4:00 PM: ...
</font></blockquote><p>
