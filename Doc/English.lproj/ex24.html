<p>Rounding out the standard kinds provided by Inform are four for living things: &quot;person&quot;, which is a kind of thing, and &quot;man&quot;, &quot;woman&quot; and &quot;animal&quot;, all kinds of person. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">In the Ballroom is a man called Mr Darcy.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>For the time being, men and women will be little more than waxworks: they will come to life only when we go beyond the present stage of creating an initial state of the world.
<p>
<p>People are either male or female: in fact, this is an either/or property for the &quot;person&quot; kind, and it affects play at run-time a little, because the player can use &quot;him&quot; and &quot;her&quot; to refer to male or female people encountered. Since &quot;animal&quot; is a kind of person, it follows that animals are also either male or female, which might seem odd for some low-level forms of life, but generally makes sense for anything mobile which one could interact with. Animals are male unless we say otherwise:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The mare is a female animal in the Stables.
</font></blockquote><p>

<p>
<p>Now finally we can put a Captain in the boat:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('The Captain is a man in the Cabin. &quot;The captain sits at the wheel, steering the boat and occasionally checking the radar readout.&quot;\n\n')"><img border=0 src=paste.png></a> The Captain is a man in the Cabin. &quot;The captain sits at the wheel, steering the boat and occasionally checking the radar readout.&quot;
