<p>Extensions look very much like passages of Inform source, because except for a special introductory and concluding sentence, that is all they are:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('The Ducking Action by Graham Nelson begins here.\n\nDucking is an action applying to nothing. Report ducking: say &quot;You duck!&quot; Understand &quot;duck&quot; as ducking.\n\nThe Ducking Action ends here.\n\n\n')"><img border=0 src=paste.png></a> The Ducking Action by Graham Nelson begins here.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Ducking is an action applying to nothing. Report ducking: say &quot;You duck!&quot; Understand &quot;duck&quot; as ducking.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Ducking Action ends here.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Not a useful or interesting extension, but those few words add a whole new action and everything needed to make it work. It is the ability in Inform 7 to mix up rooms, things, kinds, grammar, phrases and rules, in more or less any order, which makes it possible for extensions to work. If all the kinds (say) had to be defined in a single run of paragraphs, it would be impossible for different extensions each to contribute kinds of its own.
<p>
<p>The introductory sentence should be placed as the only content of line 1 of the file. Inform does not care, but this would help any other tools which might be developed later for archiving or cataloguing extensions.
<p>
<p>(In case the name is a plural, we are allowed to write &quot;begin&quot; and &quot;end&quot; instead of &quot;begins&quot; and &quot;ends&quot;. For instance, the last line of the standard rules is &quot;The Standard Rules end here.&quot;)
