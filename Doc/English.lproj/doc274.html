<p>Suppose that a (traditional) novel has been delivered to a publisher: the author has handed it over as a pile of twenty chapters of prose, and feels that it is finished. In fact there is much still to do:
<p>
<p>(a) Editing. An editor works through the book, looking for problems in the plot, uneven passages, difficulties of tone and a hundred other nuanced points. The author generally then revises the book and submits again.
<p>
<p>(b) Copy-editing. A copy-editor fixes punctuation errors, awkwardly worded sentences and other low-level problems.
<p>
<p>(c) Bibliographic data is added. So-called &quot;prelims&quot; are placed at the front of the book: a title page gives the name of the book and of the author, while an imprint page contains a variety of details about the edition, the printing, and so on. An ISBN number is allocated so that, from the number alone, any book seller or cataloguer can identify exactly this work. Sometimes other cataloguing data is added, such as the Library of Congress classification.
<p>
<p>(d) Printing. The text is given a clean, readable rendition, and no longer looks like a home-made typescript.
<p>
<p>(e) Cover art is added. Even unillustrated novels have pictorial covers, and these images are often used to set the tone for the book - they set the reader's frame of mind, so something more is happening than mere marketing.
<p>
<p>(f) A back cover blurb is added. This will also find its way into catalogues, onto book trade databases, appear on Amazon.com and so forth. Both a description and a lure, it gives a flavour of the work without actually being any part of it.
<p>
<p>(g) Binding. Not only are the inside pages printed, but maps, plates of illustrations, free CDs, fold-out charts, etc., may be tipped in to the binding.
<p>
<p>(h) Legal deposit. Copies are lodged with libraries of record, such as the British Library or the Library of Congress, to ensure that the work cannot be lost from cultural history. (In most countries, this is a legal obligation for publishers.)
<p>
<p>(i) Shipping. Copies are sent out to bookshops.
<p>
<p>(j) Publicity. The author and publisher combine to put out the word, circulate leaflets, put up posters and so forth.
<p>
<p>(k) Reviews and awards. Reviews are published, usually stirring up interest in the book. These having been stellar, a few months later the author bashfully accepts a Pulitzer Prize, the Booker or some similar token of cultural esteem.
