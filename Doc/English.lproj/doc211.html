<p>
<p>We have seen that actions, the great sluice of change in the simulated world, work their way through a great mass of rules, each applying in a different circumstance. The chapter on actions vaguely described these rules as belonging to different &quot;rulebooks&quot;: for instance, the &quot;instead rules&quot; or the &quot;carry out dropping rules&quot;.
<p>
<p>Inform is largely a rule-based system, and this extends beyond actions to other considerations, too. The &quot;every turn&quot; rules, for instance, form another rulebook but which has nothing to do with actions as such.
<p>
<p>This chapter goes into how rules and rulebooks work in much more detail, and we shall also see how to create not just new rules but new rulebooks.
