<p>The player is a thing, too, and can also be moved, which has the effect of instantaneous transportation, without the need for a suitable map connection to the new location. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">move the player to the Bodleian Library
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This will ordinarily result in a room description of the Bodleian Library being printed up, but that might not always be desirable. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of waiting in the Schola Maleficorum: say &quot;A bored demon catches your eye (they really do have very inquisitive fingers) and throws you back out into the Antechamber.&quot;; move the player to the Antechamber, without printing a room description.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Thus tacking on the option &quot;without printing a room description&quot;, remembering to add the comma, omits the description which would otherwise be produced. A compromise is to use the option &quot;printing an abbreviated room description&quot;: this gives a full description if the player has never been here before, but only a brief one if it is a familiar scene.
<p>
<p>We will see further examples of phrase options such as &quot;without printing a room description&quot;, which can modify the normal behaviour of phrases, in subsequent chapters.
