<p>
<p>We are now able to set up the model world, to respond to certain actions of the player within it, and to make changes over time, giving the game a start and an end. But although we have defined many rules, none of them have done more than to use a few basic phrases: saying something to the player, changing some property or moving things around.
<p>
<p>A phrase is a pattern of words which instructs the computer to do something immediately. For instance:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">say &quot;Look out!&quot;<br>award 20 points</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>are instructions using two phrases, &quot;say ...&quot; and &quot;award ... points&quot;. Phrases are not the same things as rules: rules lay out what should happen under what circumstances, but it is phrases that actually do what needs to be done.
<p>
<p>Where the &quot;20&quot; appears in &quot;award 20 points&quot;, any number would have done. This does not need to be a literal number expressed in digits: it can be any value known to Inform which works out as a number. For instance, &quot;the score&quot; is always acceptable as a number, since it is the name of a number variable: its value at any point in play is the current score.
<p>
<p>We are also allowed simple formulae such as
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">change the score to the score + 10</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>and similarly for &quot;-&quot;, &quot;*&quot; and &quot;/&quot;. Note the space around the plus sign: as far as Inform is concerned, &quot;+&quot; is a word like any other. (In this early release of I7, complicated formulae may not behave the way we expect: support for proper expression parsing is limited at best.)
