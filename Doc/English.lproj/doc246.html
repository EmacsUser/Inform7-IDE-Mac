<p>The original Inform 6 library allowed itself to be customised by providing &quot;entry point routines&quot;; in Inform 7, this method was replaced by activities. If an extension contains any elaborate mechanisms then it, too, should consider setting them up as activities. This is easily done. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Assaying is an activity. The last for assaying rule: ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Analysing something is an activity. The last for analysing rule: ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The former activity does not apply to any particular object, while the latter does: the difference is in the word &quot;something&quot;. (Equivalently, it could end &quot;of something&quot;, as the standard rules' activity &quot;listing contents of something&quot; does.) We can then carry out the activities with phrases like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">carry out the assaying activity;
<br>carry out the analysing activity with the dustbin;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>It may be worth noting that an activity can still be worth creating even when it is hard to imagine useful rules attached to it, because the activity also gives us a new context for other rules. The designer might well be grateful for the chance to define a &quot;rule for printing the name of a container while assaying&quot;, for instance.
