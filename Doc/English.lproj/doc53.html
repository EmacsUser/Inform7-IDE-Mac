<p>
<p>Suppose we want to coin a word for supporters currently supporting something. We can do so with the following sentence:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: a supporter is occupied if something is on it.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Note the colon, which is essential, and the usage of &quot;it&quot; in the definition part to refer to the object in question.
<p>
<p>This creates the adjective &quot;occupied&quot;, and gives it a definition valid for supporters. That restriction on validity means that non-supporters would always fail the description &quot;something occupied&quot;; which might be unfortunate if we wanted to walk about rooms being occupied. We could give a second definition thus:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: a room is occupied if a person is in it.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>These are entirely different senses of the word &quot;occupied&quot; - a mantelpiece is occupied if an invitation is on it, but for a drawing room to be occupied there must be human presence - and Inform applies whichever sense is relevant when deciding whether or not a given object is &quot;occupied&quot;.
<p>
<p>Newly defined adjectives cannot be used when creating things, because they are not explicit enough. Inform could not satisfy:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Ballroom is occupied.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>because it does not understand &quot;occupied&quot; well enough, and after all, there is not enough information: by whom is the Ballroom to be occupied? On the other hand, newly defined adjectives are very helpful in conditions and for rules, as we shall see later on.
