<p>
<p>A description can include more than one choice of action. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">examining or searching the desk
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>matches either of &quot;examining the desk&quot; or &quot;searching the desk&quot;. We can have more than two actions, of course:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">examining, looking under or searching the desk
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The actions combined like this need to be compatible with each other, at least a little. For instance, this will generate a problem message:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">waiting or searching the desk
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>because it makes no sense to &quot;wait the desk&quot;. On the other hand, this is fine:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">waiting or searching
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The general rule is that if we specify one or more objects (&quot;the desk&quot; in the above example), then each of the actions we quote must take at least that many objects.
<p>
<p>For example, the following saves us writing the same basic rule three times over:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of examining, looking under or searching the desk: say &quot;There's no use poking around in that old desk.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
