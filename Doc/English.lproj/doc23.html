<p>Next in the tour of standard kinds is the &quot;vehicle&quot;. This behaves like (indeed, is) an enterable container, except that it will not be portable unless this is specified.
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">In the Garage is a vehicle called the lawn mower.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>The player can enter the lawn mower and then move around riding inside it, by typing directions exactly as if on foot: and the game will print names of rooms with &quot;(in the lawn mower)&quot; appended, lest this be forgotten.
<p>
<p>We have already seen that some things are portable, others fixed in place. In fact we can also make a third sort of thing: those which, although not portable, can be pushed from one room to another with commands like &quot;push the lawn mover north&quot;. That seems a good idea for something like the lawn mower, so:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">The lawn mower is pushable between rooms.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>But of course this is a property which almost any thing can have, not just a vehicle. (Only &quot;almost&quot; because Inform will not allow a door to be pushable between rooms, in the interests of realism rather than surrealism.)
