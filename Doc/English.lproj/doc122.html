<p>
<p>When several different lines of grammar are supplied to meet the same circumstances, it makes a big difference what order they are tried in. For instance, suppose we have:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;photograph [a door]&quot; as photographing.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;photograph [an open door]&quot; as photographing.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>The second line is more specific than the first, so Inform takes these grammar lines the other way around: it checks for &quot;open door&quot; before it checks for &quot;door&quot;. That didn't matter here, since both lines came out with the same result (the action of photographing), but it matters very much in the next example:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;employ [a door]&quot; as opening.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;employ [an open door]&quot; as entering.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>More subtle is a line already seen:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;on/in/inside&quot; or &quot;on top of&quot; as &quot;[within]&quot;.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>Here Inform puts &quot;on top of&quot; before &quot;on/in/inside&quot;, since otherwise only the &quot;on&quot; of &quot;on top of&quot; will be recognised.
