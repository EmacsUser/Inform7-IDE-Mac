Defining phrases in Inform 6</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>The phrases described in this documentation, such as &quot;say...&quot; or &quot;start the player at...&quot;, are all defined in the Standard Rules, and are for the most part defined not in terms of other I7 phrases but instead reduced to equivalents in I6. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To end the game in death: (- deadflag=1; -).
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The notation &quot;(-&quot; and &quot;-)&quot; indicates that what comes in between is I6 code. The minus sign is supposed to be a mnemonic for the decrease from 7 to 6: later we shall use &quot;(+&quot; and &quot;+)&quot; to go back up the other way, from 6 to 7.
<p>
<p>When a phrase is defined as containing only a single command, and that command is defined using I6 - as here - it is compiled in-line. This means that the phrase &quot;end the game in death&quot; will always be translated as &quot;deadflag=1;&quot;, rather than being translated into a call to a suitable function whose only statement is &quot;deadflag=1;&quot;.
<p>
<p>This is an easy case since the wording never varies. A more typical example would be:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To say the (something - number): (- print {something}; -).
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Where the &quot;{something}&quot; appears, the appropriate I7 code is compiled to a suitable I6 expression. So, for instance,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">say the capacity of the table
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>might become
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">print O17_table.capacity;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Braces &quot;{&quot; are of course significant in I6. A real brace can be obtained by making the character following it a space, and then I7 will not attempt to read it as a request for substitution.

<table border=0 bgcolor="#e0e0e0" width=100%><tr><td><font face="lucida grande,geneva,arial,tahoma,verdana,helvetica,helv" size=2><a name="e58"><a href=doc276.html#e58><img border=0 src=../FlipOpen.png></a> <font color="#800000"><b>Example</b> (***).</font> <i>Asking the player to select a gender to begin play.</i><p>
<p>
<p>Suppose we would like to allow the player to choose a gender for the main character. We'd also like this to happen at the beginning of the game and outside the main parsing sequence. &quot;When play begins&quot; seems like a good place to put this.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('&quot;Pink or Blue&quot;\n\nWhen play begins:\n\tsay &quot;Should your character be male or female? >&quot;;\n\tif men win, now the player is male;\n\totherwise now the player is female;\n\tsay paragraph break.\n\n\n')"><img border=0 src=paste.png></a> &quot;Pink or Blue&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When play begins:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Should your character be male or female? >&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if men win, now the player is male;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise now the player is female;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say paragraph break.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now a piece of Inform 6 code handles the unusual input. It's not necessary to understand this to use it, and the code should work for any question you'd like to ask the player. The first three words in quotation marks ('male', 'M', 'man'...) correspond to positive feedback; the later three words correspond to negative feedback. So &quot;to decide whether men win&quot; will be true if the player types one of the first three, and false if he types one of the last three.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To decide whether men win:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(- Question('male','M','man','female','F','woman') -)
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Include (-
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">[ Question pos1 pos2 pos3 neg1 neg2 neg3 i;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for (::)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{   if (location == nothing || parent(player) == nothing) read buffer parse;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else read buffer parse DrawStatusLine;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i=parse-->1;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (i==pos1 or pos2 or pos3) rtrue;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (i==neg1 or neg2 or neg3) rfalse;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print &quot;Please choose &quot;, (address) pos1, &quot; or &quot;, (address) neg1, &quot;. > &quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
<br>];
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">-)
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of examining the player when the player is female:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Congratulations, you are a girl!&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of examining the player when the player is male:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Congratulations, you are a boy!&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Room of Self-Knowledge is a room. &quot;Mirrors cover every available wall-surface of this hexagonal chamber, allowing you to examine yourself from all angles.&quot;
