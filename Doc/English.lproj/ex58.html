<p>When testing conditions, we normally talk only about specific things, or else ask if a particular circumstance happens:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the oaken door is open
<br>if a woman is carrying an animal
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>But we can also use &quot;all&quot;, &quot;each&quot; or &quot;every&quot; to check the whole range:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if each door is open
<br>if anyone is carrying all of the animals
<br>if everybody is in the Dining Room
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Inform allows other English &quot;determiners&quot; (as they are sometimes called), as well:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if some of the doors are open
<br>if most of the doors are open
<br>if almost all of the doors are open
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>are true if at least one case is true, if a majority (any number greater than one half) or at least 80 per cent of the possible cases are true, respectively.
<p>
<p>And we can also use &quot;none&quot; and &quot;no&quot;. These three are all ways to say the same thing:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if no door is open
<br>if all of the doors are not open
<br>if none of the doors is open
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>though it may be clearer style to find a positive way of putting things:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if all of the doors are closed
</font></blockquote><p>

<p>
<p>This example does include a number of features that we haven't met yet, particularly rulebooks. Nonetheless, the basic idea should be relatively clear. Our premise is that the player is faced with a series of disgruntled furnishings, none of which want to be responsible for supporting the cold, hot, drippy, or spiky objects lying around the room.

<p>
<p>And just so that the player knows where he stands at the end of each turn:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Section 6 - General Assessment
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">An every turn rule:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if some of the things are concerned, say &quot;You sense some resentment from [the list of concerned things].&quot;;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">An every turn rule:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player is carrying more than one scalding thing
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let the dropped item be a random scalding thing carried by the player;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You can't hang onto so many burning hot things, and lose your grip on [the dropped item].[line break]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;silently try dropping the dropped item;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">An every turn rule:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if almost all of the supporters are concerned,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;'I hope everything is going well,' bellows Alison from the other room.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Finally, we need some rules to decide when the player is, in fact, finished.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Section 7 - Scoring
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">An every turn rule:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;change score to 5 minus the number of concerned things;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the location is concerned, change score to score minus 1;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if all of the supporters are concerned and the location is concerned, end the game in death;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if none of the supporters are concerned and the location is not concerned, end the game in victory.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The maximum score is 5.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When play begins, change score to 4.
