<p>In practice it is not enough to apply &quot;if&quot; or &quot;while&quot; to a single phrase alone: we want to give a whole list of phrases to be followed repeatedly, or to be followed only if a condition holds.
<p>
<p>We do this using &quot;begin&quot; and &quot;end&quot;, as in the following examples.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To comment upon (whatever - a thing):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if whatever is transparent then say &quot;I see right through this!&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if whatever is an open door begin;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Oh look, an open door!&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if whatever is openable then say &quot;But you could always shut it.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Here we group two phrases together under the same &quot;if&quot;. Note that the &quot;then&quot; has been replaced by &quot;begin&quot;, and that the end is marked by &quot;end if&quot;.
<p>
<p>Similarly for while:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">while (condition) begin; (... phrases ...); end while
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The &quot;begin&quot; of an &quot;if&quot; must of course match an &quot;end if&quot;, not an &quot;end while&quot;, and so on.
