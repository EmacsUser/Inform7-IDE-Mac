<p>
<p>Finally, there is a kind of relation which binds even more strongly.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Nationality relates people to each other in groups.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This is a kind of relation which divides people up: we might wish to have all the Icelandic people related to each other, all the Peruvians to each other, and so on. If there were a Pacific island called Informia with one inhabitant, then that person would be related only to himself. As time goes by, we could imagine people emigrating, and so on, so that these groupings would switch: perhaps everyone would leave Belgium and, for a while, there would be no Belgian nationals at all.
<p>
<p><hr><img border=0 src=debug.png>The testing command RELATIONS prints out the current state of all the relations created in the source code. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">>relations
<br>Overlooking relates various rooms to various rooms:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pub  >=>  the Garden
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Garden  >=>  the Shrubbery
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shrubbery  >=>  the Sundial Plot
<br>Friendship relates people to each other:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Wickham  <=>  Sophie
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlotte  <=>  Sophie
<br>Marriage relates one person to another:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Wickham  ==  Sophie

<p>
<p>The range of things one might want to do with a rope in a work of interactive fiction is fairly overwhelming. One might, in theory, swing from ropes; use them to tie containers shut; cut them up into smaller ropes; tie them together into longer ropes; employ them as fuses; bind other characters with them, or the player character.
<p>
<p>Our rope implementation is, by these lights, reasonably simple, but it does account for the possibility of tying and untying both ends; using ropes to descend into lower rooms; pulling objects tied to the far end of the rope; and dragging objects from place to place.
