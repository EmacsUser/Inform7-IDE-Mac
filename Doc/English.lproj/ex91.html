<p>
<p>Two of the adjectives built into Inform are:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;visible&quot; - the player can see this
<br>&quot;touchable&quot; - the player can touch this
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>So we can write descriptions such as &quot;someone visible&quot; or &quot;a touchable container&quot;. We also have adjectives &quot;invisible&quot; and &quot;untouchable&quot;, as might be expected. The visibility adjectives are particularly useful because the following is likely to go wrong:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if Helen is in a dark room, ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This tests whether the room is dark, of itself; Helen may in fact be able to see by means of a torch, but the room is still &quot;dark&quot;.
<p>
<p>We can also talk about what other people can see and touch:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">something able to be seen by Helen
<br>something which can be seen by Helen
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>are synonymous. Similarly for touch; and we can write such conditions as
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if Helen is unable to see Agamemnon, ...
<br>if Cressida can see Troilus, ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Note that it is essential to establish who does the seeing and touching: so &quot;something which can be seen&quot; will not be allowed, whereas &quot;something which can be seen by Helen&quot; will.
<p>
<p>In fact, inside Inform the adjective &quot;invisible&quot; (for instance) has the following straightforward definition:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: Something is invisible if the player cannot see it.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The exact definitions of visibility and touchability are complicated, because there are so many ways in which vision and touch can be obstructed, but the gist is that they behave as one would expect. Note that in darkness, nothing is visible, and that nobody can see from one room to another. In general anything invisible is also untouchable, but there are a few exceptions to do with being in the dark. Lastly, the player's own body (the player-character object, which is called &quot;yourself&quot; during play) is both visible (in light) and touchable.
<p>
<p><hr><img border=0 src=beta.png>One day &quot;something which Helen can see&quot; will be allowed, I hope, but for the moment &quot;who&quot; and &quot;which&quot; must be directly followed by the verb.

<p>
<p>Inform automatically keeps track of light and darkness, handling such questions as whether a room is lit, whether the player can see any light sources, etc., and then managing the descriptions accordingly. When the room is dark and no light sources are visible, the player is said to be &quot;in darkness&quot;.
<p>
<p>If we don't specify otherwise, Inform will describe our surroundings in a dark room thus:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Darkness
<br>It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This is fine in many situations, but we may sometimes want to replace this phrase with something else.

<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Western Hemisphere is a dark room. &quot;The cloud mass covers much of the land on this side of the planet, and a particularly nasty storm is brewing off to the south.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Eastern Hemisphere is west of the Western Hemisphere. The Eastern Hemisphere is east of the Western Hemisphere. The Eastern Hemisphere is north of the Western Hemisphere.

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Use full-length room descriptions.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Since what we see in a dark room is not the description of the room, but substitute text, we need to pre-empt looking with something else:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of looking when in darkness:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say substitute dark description.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To say substitute dark description:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[line break][bold type]Darkness[roman type][line break]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;It's night on this side of the planet, so you can make out only the glow of urbanized areas along the seacoasts.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>There's one other point when the darkness description is printed, and that is when we walk into the darkened room for the first time. So we should catch that as well:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After going when in darkness:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say substitute dark description.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And now a few minor refinements so that we can see what happens when one room becomes dark and the other light:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out going:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You fire the thrusters and loop around to the other side of the planet before settling into a new geosynchronous orbit.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The time of day is 4:55 PM.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">At 5 PM:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the Eastern Hemisphere is dark;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the Western Hemisphere is lit;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;The planet abruptly spins itself over, exposing its cool underbelly to the sun.&quot;
