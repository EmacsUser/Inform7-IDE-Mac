<p>&quot;Asking ... to try ...&quot; actions run through their Before and Instead rules like any other actions, but then (if no rule has intervened) something different happens: Inform has to decide whether the person asked consents to try the action or not. By default, the answer is always no, and text like the following will be printed:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">> will, go west
<br>Will has better things to do.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>However, we can intervene to make the answer &quot;yes&quot;, using a special kind of rule which produces a yes/no answer. The following examples show how we can give broad or narrow permission, as we choose:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Persuasion rule for asking people to try going: persuasion succeeds.
<br>Persuasion rule for asking Will to try going west: persuasion succeeds.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(Such a rule can either declare that &quot;persuasion succeeds&quot;, or that &quot;persuasion fails&quot;, or make no decision and leave it to another rule to say.) The following rule, which is really only suitable for testing, makes everybody infinitely obliging:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('Persuasion rule for asking people to try doing something: persuasion succeeds.\n\n\n')"><img border=0 src=paste.png></a> Persuasion rule for asking people to try doing something: persuasion succeeds.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Supposing that Will does decide to cooperate, a new action is generated:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Will trying going west
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>and this is then subject to all of the usual action machinery. For instance, we could write a rule such as:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of Will trying going west, say &quot;He runs out into the waves, but soon returns, rueful.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>So in this case the new action (&quot;Will trying going west&quot;) failed: but the original action, &quot;asking Will to try going west&quot;, is still deemed to have succeeded - after all, Will <i>did</i> try. To put it more formally, &quot;asking X to try A&quot; succeeds if the persuasion rules succeed, and otherwise fails.
