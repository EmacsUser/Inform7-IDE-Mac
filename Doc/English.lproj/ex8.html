<p>
<p>We have now seen several different forms of &quot;Understand&quot; sentence: for instance,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand the colour property as describing a building block.
<br>Understand &quot;mix [colour] paint&quot; as mixing paint.
<br>Understand &quot;rouge&quot; as red.
<br>Understand &quot;curious girl&quot; as Alice.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Any of these may optionally have a condition tacked on: for instance,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;mix [colour] paint&quot; as mixing paint when the location is the Workshop.
<br>Understand &quot;rouge&quot; as red when the make-up set is visible.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>In principle, &quot;when ...&quot; can take in any condition at all. In practice a little care should be exercised not to do anything too slow, or which might have side-effects. (For instance, referring the decision to a phrase which then printed text up would be a bad idea.) Moreover, we must remember that the &quot;noun&quot; and &quot;second noun&quot; are not known yet, nor do we know what the action will be. So we cannot safely say &quot;when the noun is the fir cone&quot;, for instance. If we want more sophisticated handling of such cases, we need to write checking rules and so on in the usual way.

<p>
<p>Suppose we want a bookshelf with a very large number of books on it. They aren't to be taken or carried around in the game, but they should be mentioned, and the player should be allowed to look them up by name. Furthermore, the player's attempts to examine something unrecognized should be understood as an attempt to look up a title -- but only when the player is in the presence of the books. The rest of the time such requests should be rejected in the usual way.

<p>
<p>thanks to our somewhat slovenly implementation of the Lounge scenery; but in the Reading Room,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">>x hercules
<br>You can't find any such text.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>In practice we might also want to extend our coverage somewhat to handle a case where the player tried to take books from the bookshelf: currently that would not be understood.
