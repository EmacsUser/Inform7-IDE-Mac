<p>
<p>The player is a thing, too, and can also be moved, which has the effect of instantaneous transportation, without the need for a suitable map connection to the new location. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">move the player to the Bodleian Library
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This will ordinarily result in a room description of the Bodleian Library being printed up, but that might not always be desirable. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of waiting in the Schola Maleficorum: say &quot;A bored demon catches your eye (they really do have very inquisitive fingers) and throws you back out into the Antechamber.&quot;; move the player to the Antechamber, without printing a room description.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Thus tacking on the option &quot;without printing a room description&quot;, remembering to add the comma, omits the description which would otherwise be produced. A compromise is to use the option &quot;printing an abbreviated room description&quot;: this gives a full description if the player has never been here before, but only a brief one if it is a familiar scene.
<p>
<p>We will see further examples of phrase options such as &quot;without printing a room description&quot;, which can modify the normal behaviour of phrases, in subsequent chapters.

<p>
<p>Suppose we have a game where we want the player to control two different characters, swapping bodies from one turn to the next. One player-character called &quot;yourself&quot; is predefined by default, but we can create more:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('&quot;Blood Faith&quot;\n\nTeresa is a female player-character. Teresa is in the Hay-Strewn Corridor. &quot;Teresa stands opposite you[if Teresa carries something], her fingers wrapped tightly around [list of things carried by Teresa][end if].&quot; Teresa carries a bulb of garlic and a cross. .\n\n[And we need to make the &quot;yourself&quot; player-character interesting to look out from the outside, as well:]\n\nThe initial appearance of yourself is &quot;Maleska watches you from eyes entirely black.&quot; Understand &quot;Maleska&quot; as yourself. Yourself carries a skull. Yourself is male.\n\n[And if we wanted to give our two player-characters some different abilities:]\n\nThe carrying capacity of a player-character is always 2. A player-character has a number called strength. The strength of Teresa is 3. The strength of yourself is 5\n\n[Now for the exchange of power. The player is a player-character that varies, which means that we can set it to another player-character when we choose:]\n\nEvery turn:\n\tif the player is not Teresa, change the player to Teresa;\n\totherwise change the player to yourself.\n\nWhen play begins:\n\tchange the command prompt to &quot;[bold type][player][roman type] > &quot;;\n\tchange the left hand status line to &quot;[player]&quot;;\n\tchange the right hand status line to &quot;STR: [strength of the player]&quot;.\n\n[And since we need to override the standard behavior that player-characters are called &quot;yourself&quot; under some circumstances:]\n\nRule for printing the name of Teresa: say &quot;Teresa&quot;.\n\nRule for printing the name of yourself: say &quot;Maleska&quot;.\n\nThe Hay-Strewn Corridor is a room. &quot;[if the player is yourself]The horse stalls are empty: you have already drained the animals, and carried off their corpses. The house will not long sustain you now.\n\nThe window throws on the floor a bright square of malevolent sunlight[otherwise]The stalls for horses run down one side of the room, but the house has long stood empty. A square window without shutters looks out over the ranch, away toward the Sierras[end if].&quot;\n\n\n')"><img border=0 src=paste.png></a> &quot;Blood Faith&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>

<blockquote><font color="#000080">Teresa is a female player-character. Teresa is in the Hay-Strewn Corridor. &quot;Teresa stands opposite you[if Teresa carries something], her fingers wrapped tightly around [list of things carried by Teresa][end if].&quot; Teresa carries a bulb of garlic and a cross. .
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And we need to make the &quot;yourself&quot; player-character interesting to look out from the outside, as well:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The initial appearance of yourself is &quot;Maleska watches you from eyes entirely black.&quot; Understand &quot;Maleska&quot; as yourself. Yourself carries a skull. Yourself is male.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And if we wanted to give our two player-characters some different abilities:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The carrying capacity of a player-character is always 2. A player-character has a number called strength. The strength of Teresa is 3. The strength of yourself is 5
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now for the exchange of power. The player is a player-character that varies, which means that we can set it to another player-character when we choose:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player is not Teresa, change the player to Teresa;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise change the player to yourself.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When play begins:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;change the command prompt to &quot;[bold type][player][roman type] > &quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;change the left hand status line to &quot;[player]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;change the right hand status line to &quot;STR: [strength of the player]&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And since we need to override the standard behavior that player-characters are called &quot;yourself&quot; under some circumstances:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for printing the name of Teresa: say &quot;Teresa&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for printing the name of yourself: say &quot;Maleska&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Hay-Strewn Corridor is a room. &quot;[if the player is yourself]The horse stalls are empty: you have already drained the animals, and carried off their corpses. The house will not long sustain you now.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The window throws on the floor a bright square of malevolent sunlight[otherwise]The stalls for horses run down one side of the room, but the house has long stood empty. A square window without shutters looks out over the ranch, away toward the Sierras[end if].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
