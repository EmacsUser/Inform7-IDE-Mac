<p>Ordinarily, Inform has a simple model for visibility: it is either fully light or it is fully dark, and certain actions are impossible in the dark, such as examining something. If an action is tried which was defined as requiring light, Inform consults the visibility rules to see if it can go ahead. By default, there is only one visibility rule, which says &quot;yes&quot; in the light and &quot;no&quot; in darkness. Here, though, we create another one:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Visibility rule when in darkness:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if examining the book begin;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You have to squint. Still...&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is sufficient light;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is insufficient light.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>A visibility rule must always conclude &quot;there is sufficient light&quot;, or &quot;there is insufficient light&quot;, or else do nothing and leave it to other rules to decide.
<p>
<p>It is a possibly unexpected fact that &quot;looking&quot; does not require light, but instead behaves differently in darkness - it prints a pseudo-room-description such as
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><b>Darkness</b>
<br>It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>instead of printing the description of the player's current room. This means that the &quot;looking&quot; action is unaffected by visibility rules. All the same, what &quot;looking&quot; does in the dark can be changed by using the two activities &quot;printing the name of a dark room&quot; and &quot;printing the description of a dark room&quot; (see the Activities chapter for details).
