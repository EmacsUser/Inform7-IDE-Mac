<p>
<p>Extensions are identified by author and by name, so that a given author can produce his or her own range of extensions, and need only ensure that these are named differently from each other. If John Smith and Mary Brown each want to write an extension called Following People, there is no conflict.
<p>
<p>The name of an extension, and of an author, should always be written in Full Sentence Capitalisation: that is, upper case for the first letter in each word. (Inform enforces this to avoid problems on machines where filenames are read with case sensitivity.) Abbreviations in capitals like &quot;IF&quot; or &quot;BBC&quot; are therefore best avoided.
<p>
<p>The extension name should not start with &quot;The&quot;, nor contain the words &quot;By&quot;, &quot;And&quot; or &quot;Version&quot;. Name and author's name should each be no more than 29 characters long, including any spaces between words. At present the author's name should also not contain &quot;And&quot;, but this may be changed later, in case we need to credit joint authors.
<p>
<p>Authors are asked to use real names rather than cryptic handles like &quot;ifguy&quot;, and to use genteel, plausible pseudonyms like &quot;Emily Short&quot; rather than, say, &quot;Drooling Zombie&quot; or &quot;Team Inform&quot;. Authors are also asked to use the same author's name for all their own extensions, and (it should go without saying) not to masquerade as anybody else. Those who break these guidelines may find their work dropped from archives or Inform distributions, which would be a shame for everyone.
