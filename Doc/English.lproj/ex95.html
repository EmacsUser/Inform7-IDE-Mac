<p>Inform has altogether five mutually exclusive ways in which one thing can be physically joined to another one:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">containment relation - The coin is in the purse.
<br>support relation - The coin is on the table.
<br>incorporation relation - The coin is part of the sculpture.
<br>carrying relation - The coin is carried by Peter.
<br>wearing relation - The jacket is worn by Peter.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This is why we cannot have
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The coin is on the table.
<br>The coin is part of the table.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>simultaneously, and it is a rare exception to the general rule that having one relation does not affect having another.
<p>
<p>But there is also a sixth relation used in Inform for these meanings: the possession relation, which is the meaning of the verb &quot;to have&quot;. At first sight this looks the same as the carrying relation, but in fact it is a convenient shorthand for &quot;carrying or wearing&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Mr Darcy has a rapier.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>says that Darcy is carrying the rapier at the start of play, but
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if Mr Darcy has a wet shirt ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>will be true during play if he is either carrying or wearing the shirt.
<p>
<p>Still another relation exists which can be tested, but not declared to be true or false: the concealment relation, which is the meaning of the verb &quot;to conceal&quot;. So we can ask:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if Mr Darcy conceals a fob watch ...
</font></blockquote><p>
