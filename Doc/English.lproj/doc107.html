<p>
<p>The descriptions outlined in the last few sections are intended to deal with almost all of the routine questions we might have about what currently resides where. It should be a last resort to use the following more primitive way to inspect the world.
<p>
<p>The value &quot;holder of <i>something</i>&quot; always produces the container, supporter, owner or room in which the <i>something</i> resides.
<p>
<p>It's sometimes useful to go the other way. When something has possessions, we can find them out one at a time by running through a list. Thus &quot;first thing held by Baroness Orczy&quot; will be the start of this list: say it's the lapdog. Then &quot;next thing held after the lapdog&quot; will be the second of the Baroness's possessions: a string of pearls, perhaps. And &quot;holder of the string of pearls&quot; will be the Baroness, of course.
