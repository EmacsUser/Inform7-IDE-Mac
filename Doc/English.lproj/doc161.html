<p>
<p>We can create new relations like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Loving relates various people to one person.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Each of the relations has a name of the form &quot;something relation&quot;, where the &quot;something&quot; is a single word, and in this case the name is &quot;loving relation&quot;. In such a definition, we have to say what kind of thing appears on the left and right of any relation, and also whether &quot;one&quot; or &quot;various&quot; possibilities can exist. In the example
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Loving relates various people to one person.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>what we are saying is that only people love; that they only love people; and that each person loves only one other person (at any given moment).
<p>
<p>The &quot;various&quot; part comes in because, for instance, we might have:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Verenka <i>loving relation</i> Stankevich
<br>Liubov <i>loving relation</i> Stankevich
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>so that various people (Verenka and Liubov, to name but two) love one person (Stankevich). But we are forbidding anyone to love two other people at the same time: Stankevich must decide which of them to love, or pick someone else, or no-one at all. Similarly, we would not allow
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Liubov <i>loving relation</i> Belinsky
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p><hr><img border=0 src=beta.png>In this beta release only various-to-one and one-to-various relations are supported, but future builds will allow one-to-one and various-to-various relations as well.
