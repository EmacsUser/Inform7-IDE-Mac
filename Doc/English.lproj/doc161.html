<p>
<p>Rules applied to actions can become baroque (&quot;after going through a door in the presence of an animal when&quot; and so on and so forth), but activities are again simpler: they only have one possible clause attached, which is called &quot;while&quot;. For instance, the following would provide a fairly sledgehammer hint that the sack should not lightly be thrown away:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The sack is a player's holdall. The sack is initially carried. Rule for describing the sack while the sack is not carried: say &quot;your discarded sack&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Any condition can be given after the &quot;while&quot;.
<p>
<p>In fact, though, there is another possibility: we can also specify that another activity has to be going on. Thus:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for describing the lemon sherbet while listing contents: say &quot;curious sort of lemon sherbet sweet&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This nicely distinguishes between contexts where it's appropriate for the game to be more verbose, and where it isn't. Thus:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">You can see a teaspoon and a curious sort of lemon sherbet sweet here.
<br>> TAKE ALL
<br>teaspoon: Taken.
<br>lemon sherbet: Taken.
</font></blockquote><p>
