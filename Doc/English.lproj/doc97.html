<p>
<p>We can create new conditions by defining a phrase with &quot;to decide whether&quot; (or equivalently &quot;to decide if&quot;):
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">To decide whether a dangerous place:<br>if in darkness then yes;<br>if the Control Room has been visited then no;<br>yes.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>As can be seen, such a phrase must always end with &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. We can now write, for instance,
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">if a dangerous place then ...</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>Similarly, to decide something else:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">To decide which treasure is the grand prize:<br>if the Dark Room has been visited then result the silver bars;<br>result the plover's egg.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>(Supposing, that is, that a kind called &quot;treasure&quot; has been created and that the plover's egg and the silver bars both belong to it.) And we can now say
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">if taking the grand prize then ...</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>As this is something of a dialect difference between English speakers, &quot;what&quot; and &quot;which&quot; are synonymous here, i.e., we could equally well write:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">To decide what treasure is the grand prize: ...</font></blockquote>
