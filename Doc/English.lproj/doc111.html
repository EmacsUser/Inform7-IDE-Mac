<p>When double-quoted matter appears in a column of a table, Inform will normally treat that as text for printing out. The exception is when the column is called &quot;topic&quot;, where it is treated as text for comparing against what the player has typed. There is really only one operation allowed with topic columns, the &quot;...listed in...&quot; construction, but fortunately it is the one most often needed.
<p>
<p>Let us suppose that the Sybil has a penchant for telling passers-by which is the Greek muse for what. We might write:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">After asking the Sybil about a topic listed in the Table of Sybil's Replies, say &quot;The Sybil declaims for a while, the gist being that the muse in question looks after [muse entry].&quot;</font></blockquote>

<p>We can then provide a simple table giving her responses:
