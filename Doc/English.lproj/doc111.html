<p>
<p>We have already seen &quot;or&quot; used in &quot;Understand&quot; sentences:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;scarlet&quot; or &quot;crimson&quot; as red.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>In general, any number of alternative forms can be given which are to be understood as the same thing (in this case the colour red). When the alternatives are in any way complicated, &quot;or&quot; should always be used, but a shorthand form is allowed for simple cases where it is only a matter of a single word having several possibilities:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;reach underneath/under/beneath [something]&quot; as looking under.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>This is shorthand for:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;reach underneath [something]&quot; or &quot;reach under [something]&quot; or &quot;reach beneath [something]&quot; as looking under.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>Which in turn is shorthand for:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;reach underneath [something]&quot; as looking under. Understand &quot;reach under [something]&quot; as looking under. Understand &quot;reach beneath [something]&quot; as looking under.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>To recapitulate: the slash &quot;/&quot; can only be used between single, literal words, and is best for the wayward prepositions of English (&quot;in/into/inside&quot;, and so forth). For anything more complex, always use &quot;or&quot;.
