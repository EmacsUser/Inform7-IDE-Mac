<p>Stretching a point seasonally, we might write:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn, say &quot;The summer breeze shakes the apple-blossom.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This rule is nameless. It needs no name because it will never need to be referred to: by identifying it as an every turn rule we have already said enough to lodge it in the &quot;every turn rules&quot; rulebook. In fact, though, it is easy to create a named rule:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">This is the blossom shaking rule: say &quot;The summer breeze shakes the apple-blossom.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The name of a rule must always end with the word &quot;rule&quot;, for clarity's sake. (The phrasing &quot;This is the ... rule&quot; is used because &quot;The ... rule&quot; would be open to misinterpretation.)
<p>
<p>Previously we had a rule which had no name, but belonged to a rulebook: now we have the opposite, because although the &quot;blossom shaking rule&quot; has a name, it has not been placed in any rulebook. That means it will probably never be applied. We can remedy this like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The blossom rule is listed in the every turn rules.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>A single rule like this can be listed in any number of rulebooks, including none.
<p>
<p>Alternatively, it is possible to both name and list a rule in a single sentence:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn (this is the blossom rule): say &quot;The summer breeze shakes the apple-blossom.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Where rules have been named, we are able to have a say in what order they come in:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The blossom rule is listed before the moving doorways rule in the every turn rules.
</font></blockquote><p>

<p>Names of rules can be listed in tables. This is convenient if, for instance, we decide that we'd like to swap the rules we use for a specific purpose, as in this continuation of our earlier example of automated description:
