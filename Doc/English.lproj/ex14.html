<p>
<p><b>1. When it happens.</b> &quot;Scope&quot; is a term of art in interactive fiction programming: it means the collection of things which can be interacted with at any given moment, which depends on who you are and where you are. Commands typed by the player will only be allowed to go forward into actions if the things they refer to are &quot;in scope&quot;. Inform also needs to determine scope at other times, too: for instance, when deciding whether a rule conditional on being &quot;in the presence of&quot; something is valid. It is a bad idea to say anything during this activity.
<p>
<p><b>2. The default behaviour.</b> Is complicated: see the Inform Designer's Manual, 4th edition, page 227. Briefly, the scope for someone consists of everything in the same place as them, unless it is dark.
<p>
<p><b>3. Examples.</b> (a) We very rarely want to forbid the player to refer to things close at hand, but often want to allow references to distant ones. For instance, a mirage of something which is not present at all:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After deciding the scope of the player while in the Shrine: place the holy grail in scope.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The special phrase &quot;place ... in scope&quot; does what it suggests. Ordinarily if something is placed in scope, then so are its parts and (in the case of a room, a supporter or a transparent or open container) its contents; but we can also &quot;place the box in scope, but not its contents&quot; if we really need to place just the box itself in scope.
<p>
<p>(b) Another useful device is to be able to see, but not touch, another room:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('The Cloakroom is a room. &quot;This is just a cloakroom, but through a vague, misty mirror-window you can make out the Beyond.&quot; After looking in the Cloakroom, say &quot;In the mirror you can see [list of things in the Beyond].&quot;\n\nAfter deciding the scope of the player while in the Cloakroom: place the Beyond in scope.\n\nThe Beyond is a room. Johnny Depp is a man in the Beyond.\n\n\n')"><img border=0 src=paste.png></a> The Cloakroom is a room. &quot;This is just a cloakroom, but through a vague, misty mirror-window you can make out the Beyond.&quot; After looking in the Cloakroom, say &quot;In the mirror you can see [list of things in the Beyond].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After deciding the scope of the player while in the Cloakroom: place the Beyond in scope.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Beyond is a room. Johnny Depp is a man in the Beyond.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(This must, however, also be a mirage, as at time of writing Mr Depp is alive, well and playing Willy Wonka in the forthcoming movie of &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;.)
<p>
<p>(c) In darkness, the scope of someone is ordinarily restricted to his or her possessions (and body), but we can override that:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After deciding the scope of the player while in darkness: place the location in scope.
</font></blockquote><p>

<p>
<p>Suppose we want to have a pair of linked lenses so that the player can look into one of them and see things which occur in room containing the other lens.
<p>
<p>We begin simply with a bit of environment for the player to wander around:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('&quot;Ginger Beer&quot;\n\nThe Ginger Beer Factory is a room.  &quot;In the center of the room is an enormous pot filled with crushed ginger, which seems to be bubbling slightly on its own.

The description is &quot;A large wooden box with a lid, used for ingredient storage.  There is a label on the lid.&quot;\n\nThe label is part of the box.  The description is &quot;BURDOCK: the root beaten with a little salt and laid on the place suddenly easeth the pain thereof, and helpeth those that are bit by a mad dog:... the seed being drunk in wine 40 days together doth wonderfully help the sciatica: the leaves bruised with the white of an egg and applied to any place burnt with fire, taketh out the fire, gives sudden ease and heals it up afterwards....

<p>
<p>Now for the lenses themselves:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A lens is a kind of thing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The large end of the telescope is a lens in the Ginger Beer Factory.  &quot;There is a large glass lens propped against the wall, in which are reflected all the contents of the room.&quot;  Understand &quot;glass&quot; or &quot;lens&quot; as the large end.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The small end of the telescope is a lens in the Storeroom.  &quot;There is a small glass lens sitting on the floor.  Due to some curious effect of the optics, it appears to be giving a view of somewhere else entirely.&quot;  Understand &quot;glass&quot; or &quot;lens&quot; as the small end.  The description is &quot;A gleaming lens about the size of a pound coin.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Here is the critical bit, which needs to be somewhat flexible, since the large end of the telescope could in theory be left anywhere in the game (and should still work).
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After deciding the scope of the player while the small end is carried by the player:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let there be the holder of the large end;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place there in scope.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before searching the small end when the small end is not carried by the player:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;(first picking up [the small end] and holding it to your eye)[line break]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;silently try taking the small end.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of searching the small end when the player is not carrying the small end:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;It's too hard to look through the small end from a distance.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of searching the large end,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You see only your own reflection.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We also want to make sure that the player who looks through the small lens does not see the large lens listed among the contents of the other location:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: a thing is recognizable if it is not a lens.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of searching the small end:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let the far side be the holder of the large end of the telescope;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You peer into the little lens and through it see, in [the far side], [the list of recognizable things in the far side].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And we're done.
