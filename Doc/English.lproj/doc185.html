<p>
<p><b>1. When it happens.</b> When the player chooses &quot;AMUSING&quot; from the short menu of choices after a game has been won. Traditionally, this is where the author gets to point out quirky by-ways of the game, or make some final acknowledgements, or simply salute the player's perseverance. Note that the AMUSING option is only offered when a game has ended in victory, and that it is only offered if there is at least one rule present in the &quot;for amusing a victorious player&quot; rulebook.
<p>
<p><b>2. The default behaviour.</b> None. The &quot;for amusing a victorious player&quot; rulebook is empty by default, and no amusement is available.
<p>
<p><b>3. Examples.</b> The format would be like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for amusing a victorious player: say &quot;Hmm. You're easily amused.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
