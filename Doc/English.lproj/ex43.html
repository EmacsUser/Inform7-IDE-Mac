<p>Messages sometimes need to take different forms in different circumstances. For instance, suppose we have a cask which, being a container, is always either open or closed. Then setting this:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The printed name of the cask is &quot;[if open]broached, empty cask[if closed]sealed wine-cask&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>we find that the cask is described as &quot;a broached, empty cask&quot; when open, and &quot;a sealed wine-cask&quot; when closed. Any condition can follow the &quot;if&quot;, and there will be much more about conditions later. Here is a more substantial example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Customs Wharf is a room. &quot;Amid the bustle of the quayside, [if the cask is open]many eyes stray to your broached cask. [otherwise]nobody takes much notice of a man heaving a cask about. [end if]Sleek gondolas jostle at the plank pier.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The text following &quot;[otherwise]&quot; is printed only if none of the previous &quot;if&quot; conditions have been satisfied. After the &quot;[end if]&quot;, it is back to printing as normal: so the part about gondolas is printed in every eventuality.
<p>
<p>We sometimes need to be careful about the printing of line breaks:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Cell is a room. &quot;Ah, [if unvisited]the unknown cell. [otherwise]the usual cell.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This room description has two possible forms: &quot;Ah, the unknown cell. &quot;, at first sight, and then &quot;Ah, the usual cell.&quot; subsequently. But the second form is rounded off with a line break because the last thing printed is a &quot;.&quot;, whereas the first form isn't, because it ended with a space. The right thing would have been:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Cell is a room. &quot;Ah, [if unvisited]the unknown cell.[otherwise]the usual cell.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>allowing no space after &quot;unknown cell.&quot;

<p>
<p>If we wanted, we might replace the rule for taking inventory as follows:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('Instead of taking inventory:\n\tsay &quot;You\'re carrying [list of things carried by the player][if the player wears something]. You are also wearing [list of things worn by the player][end if].&quot;\n\n\n')"><img border=0 src=paste.png></a> Instead of taking inventory:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You're carrying [list of things carried by the player][if the player wears something]. You are also wearing [list of things worn by the player][end if].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This might give us an inventory listing like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">>i
<br>You're carrying a sword, a strawberry stem and 20 credits worth of platinum. You are also wearing a sash indicating lordhood.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Because of the if statement, we can get rid of the sash and that part of the inventory sentence will disappear:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">>take off sash
<br>You take off the sash indicating lordhood.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">>drop it
<br>Dropped.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">>i
<br>You're carrying a sword, a strawberry stem and 20 credits worth of platinum.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And if the player is not carrying any items at all, the list of things carried by the player will read as &quot;nothing&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">>drop all
<br>sword: Dropped.
<br>strawberry stem: Dropped.
<br>20 credits worth of platinum: Dropped.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">>i
<br>You're carrying nothing.
</font></blockquote><p>
