<p>We often want to arrange for something to happen at some point in the future. Here is yet another timepiece:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('An egg-timer is in the Chamber. &quot;A plastic egg timer in the shape of a chicken can be pressed to set it going.&quot; Instead of pushing the egg-timer: say &quot;It begins to mark time.&quot;; the egg-timer clucks in four turns from now.\n\nWhen the egg-timer clucks: say &quot;Cluck! Cluck! Cluck! says the egg-timer.&quot;\n\n\n')"><img border=0 src=paste.png></a> An egg-timer is in the Chamber. &quot;A plastic egg timer in the shape of a chicken can be pressed to set it going.&quot; Instead of pushing the egg-timer: say &quot;It begins to mark time.&quot;; the egg-timer clucks in four turns from now.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When the egg-timer clucks: say &quot;Cluck! Cluck! Cluck! says the egg-timer.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The event here is called &quot;the egg-timer clucks&quot;. It only happens if we instruct so, which we do by writing
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">the egg-timer clucks in four turns from now
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>meaning four turns after the turn in which the egg-timer is pushed. We could alternatively describe this future moment as something like &quot;in 18 minutes from now&quot;, or &quot;at 4:15 PM&quot;.
<p>
<p>If we know in advance what time we want something to happen, we can more simply write:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">At 4 PM: say &quot;The great bells of the clock tower chime four.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>

<a name="e113"><a href=ex113.html#e113><img border=0 src=../FlipClosed.png></a> <font color="#800000">Example (**).</font> <i>A train which follows a schedule, stopping at a number of different locations.</i><p>
<table border=0 bgcolor="#e0e0e0" width=100%><tr><td><font face="lucida grande,geneva,arial,tahoma,verdana,helvetica,helv" size=2><a name="e43"><a href=doc125.html#e43><img border=0 src=../FlipOpen.png></a> <font color="#800000"><b>Example</b> (**).</font> <i>To schedule an eclipse of the sun, which involves a number of related events.</i><p>
<p>
<p>First we define the events, and then we create a phrase to schedule them:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When the penumbra appears: say &quot;The sunlight dies away to an eerie, brownish penumbra.&quot; When the eclipse begins: say &quot;The moon passes across the disc of the sun, plunging the world into darkness.&quot;; change the Chamber to dark. When the eclipse ends: say &quot;The moon passes away from the sun, and a gloomy penumbral light returns.&quot;; change the Chamber to lighted. When normal sunlight returns: say &quot;The sun shines once more bright in the sky, not to be eclipsed again on this spot for another thirty-seven years.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To schedule an eclipse for (totality - a time):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the penumbra appears at two minutes before totality;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the eclipse begins at totality;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the eclipse ends at three minutes after totality;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;normal sunlight returns at five minutes after totality.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now we make use of the new phrase:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When play begins, schedule an eclipse for 3:27 PM.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We shall see much more about creating phrases later. Their advantage is that they enable a complicated sequence of operations to be given a meaningful name, and that they can be re-used many times as needed.
