Making new relations</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>We can create new relations like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Loving relates various people to one person.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Each of the relations has a name of the form &quot;something relation&quot;, where the &quot;something&quot; is a single word, and in this case the name is &quot;loving relation&quot;. In such a definition, we have to say what kind of thing appears on the left and right of any relation, and also whether &quot;one&quot; or &quot;various&quot; possibilities can exist. In the example
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Loving relates various people to one person.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>what we are saying is that only people love; that they only love people; and that each person loves only one other person (at any given moment).
<p>
<p>The &quot;various&quot; part comes in because, for instance, we might have:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Verenka <i>loving relation</i> Stankevich
<br>Liubov <i>loving relation</i> Stankevich
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>so that various people (Verenka and Liubov, to name but two) love one person (Stankevich). But we are forbidding anyone to love two other people at the same time: Stankevich must decide which of them to love, or pick someone else, or no-one at all. Similarly, we would not allow
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Liubov <i>loving relation</i> Belinsky
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>It is sometimes convenient to give a name to the other side of a relationship, so to speak. We might imagine:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Pet-ownership relates various animals to one person (called the owner).
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>It would then make sense to talk about &quot;the owner of Loulou&quot;, and we could have phrases like &quot;now Flaubert is the owner of Loulou&quot; or &quot;if the owner of Loulou is a woman...&quot; and so forth. This, however, would not be allowed:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Pet-ownership relates various animals (called the pet) to one person.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>because &quot;the pet of Flaubert&quot; would be ambiguous: he might have owned dozens.

<p>
<p>We have two things to keep track of with our layering clothing: what currently is covering something else; and what <i>can</i> cover something else. This implementation goes for a fairly simple treatment, assuming that each item of clothing will completely conceal those beneath it, and that we are not implementing entire sets of shirts, jackets, etc. But it will do for a demonstration.
