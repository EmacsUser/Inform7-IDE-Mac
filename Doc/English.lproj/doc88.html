<p>
<p>We have seen that while rooms are fixed, their contents move around, so we will need ways to examine the current whereabouts of things. The following examples show the kind of conditions allowed:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the genie's lamp <b>is in</b> Aladdin's Cave ...
<br>if Aladdin <b>is not in</b> Aladdin's Cave ...
<br>if Aladdin's Cave <b>contains</b> the genie's lamp ...
<br>if the genie's lamp <b>is carried by</b> Aladdin ...
<br>if Aladdin <b>is holding</b> the genie's lamp ...
<br>if the genie's lamp <b>is held by</b> Aladdin ...
<br>if Aladdin <b>is carrying</b> the genie's lamp ...
<br>if Aladdin <b>does not have</b> the genie's lamp ...
<br>if Aladdin <b>has not got</b> the genie's lamp ...
<br>if the table <b>supports</b> the genie's lamp ...
<br>if the table <b>is supporting</b> the genie's lamp ...
<br>if the genie's lamp <b>is supported by</b> the table ...
<br>if the genie's lamp <b>is on</b> the table ...
<br>if the genie's lamp <b>is on top of</b> the table ...
<br>if the genie's lamp <b>is in</b> the cupboard ...
<br>if the genie's lamp <b>is contained in</b> the cupboard ...
<br>if the genie's lamp <b>is inside</b> the cupboard ...
<br>if the genie's lamp <b>is within</b> the cupboard ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>In each case, we have two descriptions and a <b>verbal relation</b> between them, always based on one of the verbs <i>to be</i>, <i>to have</i>, <i>to support</i> or <i>to contain</i>. We shall later see that we can also use three other tenses, not to mention plural forms, so &quot;had not been inside&quot; and &quot;were not supported by&quot; are also legal. What we are not allowed is to contract these verbs with apostrophes: &quot;isn't&quot;, &quot;hasn't&quot; and &quot;hadn't&quot; are forbidden.
<p>
<p>Overwhelmingly the condition we check most is whether the player is carrying something. The following are therefore equivalent:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the genie's lamp is carried by the player ...
<br>if the genie's lamp is carried ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And similarly for &quot;not carried&quot;. To be precise, if a form of <i>to be carried</i> is not followed by any other description, then &quot;the player&quot; is assumed to be doing the carrying.
