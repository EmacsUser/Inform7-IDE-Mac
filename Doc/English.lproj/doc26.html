<p>
<p>We have seen how to place objects in rooms, and in containers or on supporters, but not how to make them begin in the player's possession, which we do as follows:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">A brass lantern and an old brass key are initially carried.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>&quot;Initially carried&quot; is a special either/or property which only affects the beginning of the game.
<p>
<p>Clothes are simply things which have the either/or property of being &quot;wearable&quot;: if something has this property then the player will be allowed to wear it, provided it can first be picked up. It will then have the either/or property of being &quot;worn&quot;. To start the player off wearing something, we need only say that it is worn:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">The cardinal's hat is worn.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>This is because Inform assumes that anything said to be &quot;worn&quot; at the start of play is also likely to be &quot;wearable&quot; and &quot;initially carried&quot;. We can override these assumptions by writing something definite to the contrary:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The cardinal's hat is worn. The hat is not wearable.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The result would be a hat which could be removed but not put on again, so it is unlikely that we would want this very often.
