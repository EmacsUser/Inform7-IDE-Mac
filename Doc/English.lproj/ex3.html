<p>
<p>Another useful adjective built into Inform is &quot;adjacent&quot;. Two rooms are said to be adjacent if there is a map connection between them which does not pass through some barrier such as a door. This is easily tested:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the Hallway is adjacent to the Study ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We usually want to know about the places adjacent to the current scene of the action, so that is what the adjective &quot;adjacent&quot; means when applied to rooms. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if somebody is in an adjacent room, ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>As with the case of &quot;visible&quot;, the adjective is a cut-down version of the more general relationship. This often happens: &quot;worn&quot; and &quot;carried&quot;, for instance, imply &quot;by the player&quot; unless something else is specified.
<p>
<p>While on the subject of navigating the map, the phrase &quot;the best route from A to B&quot; gives the direction to take in order to get from A to B by the shortest number of movements between rooms - if there is any way through at all. For example, here is a lure:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The description of the brass compass is &quot;The dial points quiveringly to [best route from the location to the Lodestone Room].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Best routes are ordinarily forbidden to go through doors, but if the suffix &quot;using doors&quot; is added as an option then any open or openable and unlocked door may be used on the way; and if &quot;using even locked doors&quot; is given, then any door at all will do. Since magnetism is no respecter of property, that seems right here:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The description of the brass compass is &quot;The dial points quiveringly to [best route from the location to the Lodestone Room, using even locked doors].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The phrase &quot;the best route from A to B&quot; gives the direction to take next, if we are at A and want to end up at B. Suppose this is east. We can find out where we go next by looking up &quot;the room east from A&quot;: similarly for any other direction, of course. (This can see through any doors, locked or not.)
<p>
<p>We can also find out how long the journey would be:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The description of the proximity gadget is &quot;You are now [number of moves from the location to the Sundial] moves from the Sundial.&quot;;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This number is, of course, 0 if the location is already the Sundial. If there is no way at all to get to the Sundial, the number is -1.
