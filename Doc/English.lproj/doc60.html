<p>
<p>To recap, actions are normally generated when the player types a command, but they can also be started by the &quot;try&quot; phrase. What then happens is as follows:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">1. If any before rule applies then it is obeyed.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">2. If the action needs light to see by, that is checked; if it needs physical access to its objects, that too is checked.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">3. If any instead rule applies then it is obeyed and the action is automatically stopped.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">4. The &quot;check&quot; rules for the given action are obeyed, to see if it is possible. For example, the &quot;check taking&quot; rules will prevent the player from taking something which is fixed in place.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">5. The &quot;carry out&quot; rules for the given action are obeyed. For example, the &quot;carry out taking&quot; rules actually move the given object into the player's possession. The action is now declared a success.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">6. If any after rule applies then it is obeyed and the action is automatically stopped.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">7. The &quot;report&quot; rules for the given action are obeyed. For example, the &quot;report taking&quot; rules always just say &quot;Taken.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>In practice we can forget about the check, carry out and report rules unless we are creating new actions or meddling with the definition of existing ones: almost everything we need to do can be done with before, instead and after rules.
