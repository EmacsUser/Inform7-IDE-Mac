<p>
<p>Sometimes a value important to the simulated world will not naturally belong to any thing or room, and should not be kept in a property. For example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The prevailing wind is a direction that varies. The prevailing wind is southwest.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Or &quot;which varies&quot; would also be allowed, as would the more traditional computing term &quot;variable&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The target is a number variable. The target is 23.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>In fact, we have seen a value that varies already: &quot;location&quot;, which holds the room in which the game is presently taking place.
<p>
<p>It's important to tell Inform what kind of value goes into the variable, as this will ensure that the wrong kind of value is never accidentally put into it.
<p>
<p>We can have variables of any of the kinds of value, including new ones, but should watch out for a potential error. If we write:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The receptacle is a container that varies.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>in a design which has no containers at all, Inform will object, because it will be unable to put any initial value into the receptacle variable. A similar complaint will be made if we write:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Colour is a kind of value. The fashionable shade is a colour that varies.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>without ever having defined any colours. Something else we are not permitted is:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The receptacle is an open container that varies.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>because the openness of a given container may change during play, so that the value in the variable might suddenly become invalid even though the variable itself had not changed.
