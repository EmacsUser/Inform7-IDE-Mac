<p>Creating a new rulebook is also straightforward, as we see in the following modest example game:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Appraisal&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Passage is east of the Tomb. The green-eyed idol is in the Tomb. A Speak-Your-Progress machine is in the Passage.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Appraisal rules is a rulebook.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">An appraisal rule: say &quot;Click... whirr... the score is [the score in words] points.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">An appraisal rule: if we have taken the idol then say &quot;Most importantly of all, the idol has been found.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of switching on the machine, follow the appraisal rules.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The creation of the rulebook is all very well, but without the final sentence it would never be used. The crucial new phrase here is &quot;follow ...&quot;, which is the first of several phrases allowing us to use rules whenever we want to (rather than simply at predetermined times such as when a particular action is being tried, or at the end of every turn, and such).
<p>
<p>Like &quot;number&quot; or &quot;text&quot;, &quot;rule&quot; and &quot;rulebook&quot; are kinds of value built into Inform: &quot;the blossom rule&quot; is a value whose kind is &quot;rule&quot;, whereas &quot;the every turn rules&quot; is a value whose kind is &quot;rulebook&quot;. In fact, Inform considers a rulebook to be a special case of a rule, so that whenever a rule is required it is legal to name a rulebook instead, but not vice versa. The &quot;follow&quot; phrase here...
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of switching on the machine, follow the appraisal rules.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>...expects to be applied to a value of kind &quot;rule&quot;; &quot;the appraisal rules&quot; is in fact a rulebook, but since that counts as a rule and the phrase makes sense to Inform. To follow a rulebook means to run through all its rules in turn; to follow a single rule means just that one, of course.
