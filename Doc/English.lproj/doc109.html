<p>
<p>The following kind of loop could if necessary be achieved just as well with a suitable &quot;while&quot;, but occurs so often that it is convenient to have a standard form. Repeat loops also have the great advantage of being certain to finish.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">repeat with my counter running from 1 to 10 begin;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(phrases)
<br>end repeat;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This is similar to the old FOR/NEXT loop from BASIC, for those with long memories, and runs through the given phrases ten times. Within those phrases, a special value called &quot;my counter&quot; has the value 1 the first time through, then the value 2, then 3 and so on up to 10. This value exists only within the loop, so it makes no sense to talk about &quot;my counter&quot; elsewhere. (It can of course be called whatever we like: this is only an example.)
<p>
<p>The &quot;begin&quot; and &quot;end repeat&quot; are compulsory for repeat loops, in the interests of clarity.
<p>
<p>We are allowed to &quot;nest&quot; loops, that is, to put one inside another.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To plot a grid with size (S - a number):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with x running from 1 to S begin;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Row [x]:&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with y running from 1 to S begin;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot; [y]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end repeat;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end repeat.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>If we then write
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">plot a grid with size 5</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>then the result is
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">Row 1: 1 2 3 4 5.<br>Row 2: 1 2 3 4 5.<br>Row 3: 1 2 3 4 5.<br>Row 4: 1 2 3 4 5.<br>Row 5: 1 2 3 4 5.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>Thus the innermost phrase, the say which mentions &quot;y&quot;, happens 25 times.
