<p>
<p>An entire column of blank entries &quot;--&quot; is problematic:
<p>
<p><center><img src=table4.tiff></center>
<p>
<p>Inform is unable to work out what kind of value should go into the &quot;atomic weight&quot; column here, since it has no examples to guess from. We can get around this by writing in the name of a kind of value:
<p>
<p><center><img src=table5.tiff></center>
<p>
<p>That top entry in the &quot;atomic weight&quot; column is also blank, but now Inform knows that anything put into the column in future will be a number.
<p>
<p>If there are many rows, and perhaps several blank columns, it would become very tedious to have to keep typing out &quot;--&quot;. So this is optional <i>at the end of a row</i>: it remains compulsory for a blank value appearing in between two values which aren't blank. This is the general idea:
