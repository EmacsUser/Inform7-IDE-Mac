<p>Let us suppose that somebody gets off the train, after all, so that a second scene follows on.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Brief Encounter is a scene. Brief Encounter begins when Train Stop ends.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The effect of this is that they occur in sequence. If we add a third to the chain of scenes:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Village Exploration is a scene. Village Exploration begins when Brief Encounter ends.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>...we find another chance to fool ourselves: if we check the Scenes index again, we can see the linkages between these scenes, but we also see that Brief Encounter never ends (despite its name). All we have said is that another scene begins where Brief Encounter leaves off, but it never does, so this is moot.
