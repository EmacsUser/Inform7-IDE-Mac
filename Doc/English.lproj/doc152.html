<p>A condition is a yes/no decision, but we can also take decisions where the result is a value. Suppose we want to create a concept of the &quot;grand prize&quot;, which will have different values at different times in play. Each time the &quot;grand prize&quot; is referred to, Inform will have to decide what its value is, and the following tells Inform how to make that decision:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To decide which treasure is the grand prize:
<br>if the Dark Room has been visited then result the silver bars;
<br>result the plover's egg.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Note that we have to say what kind the answer will be: here it's a kind of thing called &quot;treasure&quot; (which we're supposing has already been created), and as it turns out only two treasures are ever eligible anyway (we're also supposing that the plover's egg and the silver bars are treasures already created, of course.) Now that we have &quot;grand prize&quot; created, we can use it just as we would use any other value, so for instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if taking the grand prize then ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>As this is something of a dialect difference between English speakers, &quot;what&quot; and &quot;which&quot; are synonymous here, i.e., we could equally well write something like:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To decide what number is the target score: ...
</font></blockquote><p>
