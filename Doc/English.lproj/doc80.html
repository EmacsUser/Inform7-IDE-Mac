<p>
<p>The command prompt is the text printed by Inform to ask the player for another command. Ordinarily this is simply a greater-than-sign, &quot;>&quot;, so we tend not to notice it as text at all. Internally, though, it is a variable value called &quot;command prompt&quot;, which means we can change it.
<p>
<p>For example, this will be a more conversational sort of prompt:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">When play begins: change the command prompt to &quot;What now? &quot;.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>Whereas this will be more up-to-the-minute and demanding:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">When play begins: change the command prompt to &quot;[time of day] >&quot;.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>(&quot;Time of day&quot; is another variable value, which is fairly self-explanatory, but will be covered in detail later on.) The prompt can be changed at any point, so can be used to indicate the current situation, or even as a sly way to introduce a sort of conversation between computer and player.
