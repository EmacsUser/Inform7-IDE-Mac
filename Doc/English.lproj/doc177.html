<p>
<p>There are times when it is not convenient to write a suitable &quot;for ...&quot; rule, or when we cannot be bothered. For such times we are allowed to write:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">begin the analysing activity with the dustbin;
<br>...
<br>end the assaying activity with the dustbin;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>but we need to be careful to follow the golden rules: all activities must end, they must never last longer than a turn, and if activity B starts during activity A then it must also finish during activity A. We must also be careful to make sure that if an activity applies to something, then it begins and ends with the same something (the dustbin, in the above example).
<p>
<p>The before rules are considered at the time of the &quot;begin ...&quot; phrase; the after rules at the &quot;end ...&quot;. What, then, of the &quot;for&quot; rules? In the above setup, they would simply be ignored. We can make them effectual like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">begin the analysing activity with the dustbin;
<br>...
<br>if the analysing activity with the dustbin is required begin;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
<br>end if;
<br>...
<br>end the assaying activity with the dustbin;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The &quot;for&quot; rules are invoked when the test about requirement is carried out: the condition is true only if no rule has intervened. Thus the &quot;...&quot; inside the &quot;if&quot; is the place to put the default behaviour of the activity.
