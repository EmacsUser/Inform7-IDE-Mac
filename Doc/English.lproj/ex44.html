<p>
<p>We have already used the example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Loving relates various people to one person.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Let us create a verb which expresses this:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The verb to love (he loves, they love, he loved, he is loved) implies the loving relation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Note that we have omitted one of the parts of the verb. Actually we can legally miss out any of them, but the result is that the usages missed out will not be understood by Inform. In this case, Inform will understand
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Elizabeth loves Darcy.
<br>if anybody has been loved by Darcy, ...
<br>someone who is loved by Elizabeth
<br>the number of women who love Darcy
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>but it will not understand
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Elizabeth is loving Darcy.
<br>if Darcy is loving anybody, ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>because we did not supply the present participle &quot;he is loving&quot; as part of the definition of the verb. (That was deliberate, because the verb &quot;to love&quot; isn't used that way.)
<p>
<p>Similarly, using our reciprocated relation for mere acquaintanceship,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Meeting relates people to each other. The verb to know (he knows, they know, he knew, he is known) implies the meeting relation. Elizabeth knows Mr Wickham. Mr Wickham knows Mr Darcy.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>As usual, &quot;now&quot; can be used to change the state of the relation:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">now Elizabeth loves Bingham
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>But Inform will not allow this:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">now Elizabeth does not love Bingham
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>because, given the various-to-one nature of the relation, Inform knows that Elizabeth must love either one specific person or else nobody. It therefore thinks that ruling out specific individuals, as here, is misleading. Instead, we can cast Elizabeth adrift with an open heart thus -
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">now Elizabeth does not love anybody
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Such instructions are required to use the right kind: here we have &quot;anybody&quot; since the object of Elizabeth's love must be a person. For a relation of various people to one room, it would be &quot;anywhere&quot;; for a relation of various people to one thing, it would be &quot;anything&quot;.

<p>We have two things to keep track of with our layering clothing: what currently is covering something else; and what <i>can</i> cover something else. This implementation goes for a fairly simple treatment, assuming that each item of clothing will completely conceal those beneath it, and that we are not implementing entire sets of shirts, jackets, etc. But it will do for a demonstration.
