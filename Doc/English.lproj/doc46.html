<p>
<p>As the following examples show, sentences can make several assertions at once by using the plural. Suppose we have defined a kind called &quot;high-up fixture&quot;, for instance like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A high-up fixture is a kind of thing. A high-up fixture is usually fixed in place.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Then the following sentence creates two such objects and puts them in their place:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The high shelf and the skylight window are high-up fixtures in the Lumber Room.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>since it is equivalent to saying:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The high shelf is a high-up fixture. The skylight window is a high-up fixture. The high shelf is in the Lumber Room. The skylight window is in the Lumber Room.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Such plurals are allowed in almost any context, and we could even define two kinds at once:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Bucket and basket are kinds of container.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Inform constructs plurals by a fairly primitive rule, and English is so irregular a language that a more complicated rule would probably not be very much better. We sometimes need to intervene:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The plural of ox is oxen. An ox is a kind of animal.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Note that we specify the plural <i>before</i> creating the kind called &quot;ox&quot;: otherwise it will have plural &quot;oxes&quot;, that being the best that Inform knew at the time.
<p>
<p>A particular case worth mentioning: as far as Inform is concerned, the plural of &quot;person&quot; is &quot;people&quot;, not &quot;persons&quot;.
<p>
<p><hr><img border=0 src=beta.png>For the time being, please avoid syllepsis such as &quot;Darcy is wearing a hat and carrying a fishing rod.&quot;, where the &quot;and&quot; couples together prepositions (or verbs) rather than nouns.
