<p>
<p>Moving on to properties which contain values, such as the &quot;matching key&quot; property of a door or a container, we need to use a different formulation.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A dead end has a property called river sound. The river sound of a dead end is usually &quot;a faint whispering of running water&quot;. The Tortuous Alcove has river sound &quot;a gurgle of running water&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The property &quot;river sound&quot; is now applicable only to dead ends, and we would not be allowed to talk about it in any other context. As can be seen, it holds a piece of text. If we tried the following:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The river sound of the Tortuous Alcove is 7.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>...then Inform would object, because the number 7 is the wrong kind of value to go into the &quot;river sound&quot; property. If we need a numerical property, we can try this instead:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A dead end has a number called the difficulty rating. The Tortuous Alcove has difficulty rating 7.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(When we say &quot;has a property called...&quot; we implicitly allow it to hold either text or the name of a room or object, since it is often convenient to be able to store both interchangeably in the same property.)
<p>
<p>If we ever need to check whether or not a given object has a property, we can test something like this:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">If the location has a river sound, ...
</font></blockquote><p>
