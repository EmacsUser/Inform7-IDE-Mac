<p>Descriptions can contain a noun, but need not, and can contain any number of adjectives:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">supporter = <i>the noun</i> supporter
<br>closed = <i>the adjective</i> closed
<br>the open wine cask = <i>the adjective</i> open + <i>the noun</i> wine cask
<br>something portable = (some) + <i>the noun</i> thing + <i>the adjective</i> portable
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Note that we are not allowed to have more than one noun in the same description (something English occasionally does allow as a coded form of emphasis, as in &quot;the man Jenkins&quot; or &quot;the harlot Helen&quot;).
<p>
<p>Nouns are simple enough, referring either to kinds or specific things. The noun &quot;something&quot; means &quot;some thing&quot;, so is actually a reference to the kind &quot;thing&quot;. Inform treats this as having the same meaning as &quot;anything&quot;, and all told there are eight special nouns of this kind, but with only three different meanings between them:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">something = anything
<br>someone = anyone = somebody = anybody
<br>somewhere = anywhere
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>So for instance &quot;anybody male&quot; or &quot;somewhere dark&quot; are valid descriptions. These eight nouns are unusual in being allowed to come at the front of a description: all other nouns are expected to be at the end.
