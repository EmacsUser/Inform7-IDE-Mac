<p>
<p>Another useful adjective built into Inform is &quot;adjacent&quot;. Two rooms are said to be adjacent if there is a map connection between them which does not pass through some barrier such as a door. This is easily tested:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the Hallway is adjacent to the Study ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We usually want to know about the places adjacent to the current scene of the action, so that is what the adjective &quot;adjacent&quot; means when applied to rooms. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if somebody is in an adjacent room, ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>As with the case of &quot;visible&quot;, the adjective is a cut-down version of the more general relationship. This often happens: &quot;worn&quot; and &quot;carried&quot;, for instance, imply &quot;by the player&quot; unless something else is specified.
