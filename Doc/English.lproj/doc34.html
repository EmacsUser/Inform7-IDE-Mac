<p>Messages sometimes need to take different forms in different circumstances. For instance, suppose we have a cask which, being a container, is always either open or closed. Then setting this:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">The printed name of the cask is &quot;[if open]broached, empty cask[if closed]sealed wine-cask&quot;.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>we find that the cask is described as &quot;a broached, empty cask&quot; when open, and &quot;a sealed wine-cask&quot; when closed. Any condition can follow the &quot;if&quot;, and there will be much more about conditions later. Here is a more substantial example:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">The Customs Wharf is a room. &quot;Amid the bustle of the quayside, [if the cask is open]many eyes stray to your broached cask. [otherwise]nobody takes much notice of a man heaving a cask about. [end if]Sleek gondolas jostle at the plank pier.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>The text following &quot;[otherwise]&quot; is printed only if none of the previous &quot;if&quot; conditions have been satisfied. After the &quot;[end if]&quot;, it is back to printing as normal: so the part about gondolas is printed in every eventuality.
