<p>As we have just seen, making something &quot;fixed in place&quot; will prevent it from being picked up or moved. But it remains substantial enough to be described in its own paragraph of text when the player visits its location. This can be unfortunate if it has also been described already in the body of the main description for that location. For instance, if we wrote:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Orchard is a room. &quot;Within this quadrille of pear trees, a single gnarled old oak remains as a memory of centuries past.&quot; The gnarled old oak tree is fixed in place in the Orchard.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This would end up describing the oak twice, once in the paragraph about the Orchard, then again in a list of things within it:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><b>Orchard</b>
<br>Within this quadrille of pear trees, a single gnarled old oak remains as a memory of centuries past.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">You can see a gnarled old oak tree here.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We avoid this by making it &quot;scenery&quot; instead of &quot;fixed in place&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The gnarled old oak tree is scenery in the Orchard.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Any thing can be scenery, and this does not bar it from playing a part in the game: it simply means that it will be immobile and that it will not be described independently of its room.

<p>
<p>If we compile our last version of the cabin, we get a room where the glass case and the bench are listed separately from the room description, even though they have already been mentioned once. We can prevent this by making the already-mentioned things scenery:
<p>

<p>
<p>The door and the view will need to be done as well, but they are special cases which we will get to shortly.
<p>
<p>As noted, making something scenery also means that the player will be prevented from picking it up and carrying it away. This is sensible, though: if an object can be removed from the room where it first appears, we should be careful about mentioning it in the main room description; otherwise, it will continue to be described as present even when someone has carried it off.
