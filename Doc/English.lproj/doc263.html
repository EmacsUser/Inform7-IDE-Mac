<p>The Inform documentation has tried not to be too formal about grammar, to avoid spelling out in technical language what the reader already knows perfectly well about everyday English. All the same, some readers will want to know exactly what is Inform's idea of a sentence, or indeed a noun, and the following short account gives a (very nearly) exact description. It is intended only to explain why some things are accepted and others not. No new features of the language are described, and this is very much an appendix, not part of the manual proper.
<p>
<p>Let us start with two major grammatical structures. One is the Description Phrase, or DP for short, examples of which include &quot;the red basket&quot;, &quot;somewhere lighted&quot; and &quot;an empty open container&quot;. This we will take as read, since the account given at the start of Chapter 5 is quite explicit. The other is the Sentence, which we will write S, an example of which is:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The horseman wears a riding helmet.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We have been much vaguer about the definition of &quot;sentence&quot;. Clearly sentences include DPs, but they also include other ingredients. How does this work?
<p>
<p>The general pattern used in Inform is very simple:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">1. S = DP + VP
<br>2. VP = Verb + DP
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>where VP is a &quot;Verb Phrase&quot;. Using these two rules, we can break down the above example sentence like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">S (The horseman wears a riding helmet)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= DP (The horseman) + VP (wears a riding helmet)
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>and then:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">VP (wears a riding helmet)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= Verb (wears) + DP (a riding helmet)
</font></blockquote><p>
