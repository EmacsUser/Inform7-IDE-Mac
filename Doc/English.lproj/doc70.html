<p>
<p>Traditionally-written games award points throughout play, as an indication of progress. If we want to be traditional, we can award points as follows:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">award 5 points;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>substituting whatever number we feel is appropriate. We should be careful not to give out the same points over and over, that is, not to reward the same basic achievement many times over if the player simply repeats the same action. This, for instance, is open to abuse:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">After taking the trophy: award 5 points; say &quot;Well done!&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>The player may simply take the trophy, drop it again, take it again, ... and win five points every time around. We can prevent this by phrasing the rule more carefully:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">After taking the trophy for the first time: award 5 points; say &quot;Well done!&quot;</font></blockquote>
