<p>
<p><b>1. When it happens.</b> This activity prints up the also-ran paragraph at the end of a room description. These are nondescript items because they don't merit paragraphs of their own: if, as sometimes happens, there are none in the room, then no such paragraph is printed and this activity does not happen. (So to add a further paragraph to a room description, a simpler &quot;after looking&quot; rule should be used, not an &quot;after listing nondescript items&quot; rule.)
<p>
<p><b>2. The default behaviour.</b> The paragraph ordinarily reads as &quot;You can also see a cask and a clock.&quot; or similar. Before the activity begins, those objects which are nondescript - in this case the cask and the clock - are given the property of being &quot;marked for listing&quot;. If it turns out that nothing is marked for listing, because of before rules like the one in the example below, then nothing is printed.
<p>
<p><b>3. Examples.</b> (a) Promoting something out of the nondescript category, by unmarking it.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before listing nondescript items:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the watch is marked for listing begin;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;The watch catches your eye.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;change the watch to not marked for listing;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(b) Changing the normal phrasing of the paragraph. Note that we can also change the listing style; the one below is the default.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for listing nondescript items of the Distressingly Messy Room:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Strewn carelessly on the floor&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;list the contents of the Distressingly Messy Room, as a sentence,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tersely, listing marked items only, prefacing with is/are,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;including contents and giving brief inventory
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;information;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
