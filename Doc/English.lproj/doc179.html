Making the verb "to weigh"</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>We have already created new verbs: for instance, in the previous chapter we set up a verb &quot;to love&quot;, which was such that we could say &quot;A loves B&quot; for people A and B. Suppose we want a verb &quot;to weigh&quot;, in the sense of &quot;the lead pig weighs 45kg&quot;. This is not like &quot;to love&quot;, because it relates something tangible (the lead pig) to something intangible (45kg). So its creation looks a little different:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The verb to weigh (it weighs, they weigh, it is weighing) implies the weight property.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Our previous verb definitions ended &quot;implies the ... relation&quot;, rather than &quot;implies the ... property&quot;, but otherwise the idea is the same. The effect is that we can say things like:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A thing usually weighs 1kg. The lead pig weighs 45kg.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">something weighing 20kg
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if three things weigh 5kg, ...
</font></blockquote><p>
