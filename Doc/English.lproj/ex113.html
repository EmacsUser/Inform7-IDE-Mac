<p>
<p>If we want to impose the restriction about carrying the camera on everyone, we need a rule like the following:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Check someone trying photographing: if the person asked does not carry the camera, stop the action.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Implicitly, that &quot;someone&quot; excludes the player. Note that we say nothing in this rule, stopping the action without a word: after all, Clark might well be out of sight when trying this. If he is within sight, then we read:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">>clark, photograph me
<br>Clark Gable is unable to do that.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We saw before that Inform's built-in rules all have handy names (the &quot;can't drop what's already dropped rule&quot;, and such), and that these are useful when writing better &quot;unable to...&quot; messages. So for a deluxe version, we end up with:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Check someone trying photographing (this is the other people can't photograph without the camera rule): if the person asked does not carry the camera, stop the action.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And now, with ACTIONS on, we find that:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">>clark, photograph me
<br>[asking Clark Gable to try photographing yourself]
<br>[(1) Clark Gable trying photographing yourself]
<br>[(1) Clark Gable trying photographing yourself - failed the other people can't photograph without the camera rule]
<br>Clark Gable is unable to do that.
<br>[asking Clark Gable to try photographing yourself - succeeded]
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>which means that we could have, say,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Unsuccessful attempt by Clark trying photographing:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the reason the action failed is the other people can't photograph without the camera rule, say &quot;Clark is too suave to be embarrassed. 'Frankly, my dear, I don't have a camera.'&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;Clark tries, and fails, to take a photograph.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>

<p>
<p>We could now re-write the check rules so that any time someone (the player or someone else) tries to pick up a container which he is in, he will first get out:
<p>
