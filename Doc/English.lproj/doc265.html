<p>
<p>In the example &quot;The horseman wears a riding helmet&quot; the Verb part was indeed a single verb: the word &quot;wears&quot;. More generally, Inform allows a Verb to include adverbs and prepositions, to be negated, and to come in any of four tenses, so the following are all valid as Verb in our grammar:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">wore
<br>carries
<br>is carried by
<br>had not been inside
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>That does not mean every Verb makes sense in an assertion. For instance, Inform will reject this:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The silver plate is not on the table.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Inform needs to be told where it is, not where it isn't. Similarly, we are not allowed to say that:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The silver plate has been on the table.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>because assertions are supposed to talk about the world <i>now</i>, at the start of play, and to use the present tense.
<p>
<p>So why have negatives and past tenses? Inform uses the same basic grammar for conditions - questions about the world as it evolves during play - as it does for assertions - factual statements about the initial state. For instance, because
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The silver plate is on the table.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>is a valid sentence S, we can also write
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the silver plate is on the table then ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>when we come to setting up rules of play (in the next chapter). And once play has begun, it makes perfect sense to ask questions in the negative, or to talk about the past:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the silver plate is not on the table then ...
<br>if the silver plate has been on the table then ...
</font></blockquote><p>
