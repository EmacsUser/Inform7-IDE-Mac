<p>Lohmus, A. 1999: Vole-induced regular fluctuations in the Estonian owl populations. Ñ Ann. Zool. Fennici 36: 167Ð178.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Estonia has been considered to hold non-cyclic vole populations, which should be revealed in owl productivity or movements. I asked (1) whether owl and vole populations fluctuate regularly in Estonia, (2) are the fluctuations in Estonia synchronous to those in its neighbouring areas, (3) do Estonian and northern owl populations exchange individuals? I found significant periodicity in owl reproduction, which was linked to vole abundance, suggesting that Estonia belongs to the transition zone between cyclic and non-cyclic vole populations. The migration intensities of nomadic owl species were positively correlated with each other, and in the long-eared owl related to its productivity. Having found that owl productivity fluctuates independently in Estonia and southern Finland, and owls do not move freely between the countries, I discussed possible causes for this.
