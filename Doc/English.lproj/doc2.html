<p>I should like to dedicate this new edition of Inform to Emily Short and Andrew Plotkin, whose shrewd and sceptical suggestions made a contribution which can hardly be overstated: a long email correspondence with Andrew entirely subverted my original thoughts about natural-language IF, as he convinced me that the &quot;new model&quot; of rule-based IF was a truer foundation; while Emily's wry, witty analysis and how-about-this? not only cheered me at low moments, but also provided the impetus and often the specifics for a lot of the best ideas. Emily is the author of almost all of the more than 200 Examples in this documentation.
<p>
<p>Among those who kindly gave up great swathes of time to test, and think about, Inform 7, I must give special thanks to Sonja Kesserich, who was so often patient, and so often right. Her easy-going &quot;pestering&quot; (Sonja's word) led to improvements more or less everywhere, especially in the early days when Inform 7 was not much fun. I also thank David Cornelson for gathering volunteers, and I thank them, too.
<p>
<p>From the outset, I have thought of Inform 7 as no longer being a command-line compiler, but a compiler in combination with a radically more humanising user interface: all credit for the reference implementation under Mac OS X belongs to Andrew Hunter. I thank him for his forbearance in the face of much cajolery. How simple the metaphor of an interactive book with facing pages may seem, but the coding was an enormous challenge, and I could not have done it.
<p>
<p>Though David Kinder's Windows implementation of the user interface does indeed follow on from Andrew's original, the two programs were able to share little or no code, and the coding task taken up by David was formidable indeed. He also uncovered numerous bugs in the compiler which, through one coincidence or another, did not reveal themselves under OS X.
