<p>
<p>I should like to dedicate this new edition of Inform to Emily Short and Andrew Plotkin, whose shrewd and sceptical suggestions made a contribution which can hardly be overstated: a long email correspondence with Andrew entirely subverted my original thoughts about natural-language IF, as he convinced me that the &quot;new model&quot; of rule-based IF was a truer foundation; while Emily's wry, witty analysis and how-about-this? not only cheered me at low moments, but also provided the impetus and often the specifics for a lot of the best ideas.
<p>
<p>Among those who kindly gave up great swathes of time to test, and think about, Inform 7, I must give special thanks to Sonja Kesserich, who was so often patient, and so often right. Her easy-going &quot;pestering&quot; (Sonja's word) led to improvements more or less everywhere. Methodically hitting every exposed surface of Inform with a goldsmith's hammer, Sonja and Emily made a formidable double act.
<p>
<p>Though a command-line version of Inform 7 will also be released, I have thought of it throughout in combination with a radically more humanising user interface: all credit for this reference implementation, which I hope will be imitated on other platforms, belongs to Andrew Hunter. I thank him for his forbearance in the face of much cajolery. If you are reading this in Inform's Documentation panel, you will need no persuading of his achievement.
