<p>
<p>Every extension, including the Standard Rules, has the right to its own set of headings and subheadings, independently of those used by the main source for the work or by any other extension which may be included. So if the extension is divided into four sections and finishes on Section D, say, that doesn't mean that Section D will continue outside the extension as the main source of the game runs on.
<p>
<p>Extensions should, of course, never produce errors, so at first sight it appears that these headings will never be outwardly visible. In fact, though, they are used when indexing phrases (and also actions) to group similar phrases together. For instance, the Standard Rules contain the heading:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Section SR4/7 - Searching and sorting tables
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The half-dozen phrases defined in this section of the Standard Rules are then indexed under the subheading &quot;Searching and sorting tables&quot;: Inform looks for a hyphen in the heading and then uses any text which follows the hyphen. (If there is no hyphen, the entire heading text is used.)
<p>
<p>If an extension contains no headings, its phrases (or actions) are indexed simply as &quot;Miscellaneous&quot;.
