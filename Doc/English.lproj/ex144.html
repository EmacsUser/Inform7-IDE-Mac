Let and temporary variables</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>A variable, as we have seen, is a name for a value which changes, though always remaining of the same kind. For instance, if &quot;target&quot; is a number variable (or &quot;number that varies&quot;) then it may change value from 2 to 4, but not from 2 to &quot;fishknife&quot;.
<p>
<p>To make complicated decisions, phrases often need to remember values on a temporary basis. We have already seen this for the counter in a &quot;repeat&quot; loop, which exists only inside that loop, and then is no longer needed. Now we define named values which exist only inside the current phrase. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">let outer bull be 25;
<br>let the current appearance be &quot;reddish brown&quot;;
<br>let the special room be Marley Wood;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>creates temporary variables &quot;outer bull&quot;, &quot;current appearance&quot; and &quot;special room&quot;. The kinds of these are deduced from the values given, so that, for instance,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">say &quot;The outer bull scores [the outer bull in words] when you practice archery in [special room].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>produces
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The outer bull scores twenty-five when you practice archery in Marley Wood.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Temporary variables made by &quot;let&quot; are only temporarily in existence while a phrase is being carried out. Their values often change: we could say
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">let x be 10;
<br>change x to 11;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>for instance, or indeed we could &quot;let x be 10&quot; and then &quot;let x be 11&quot;. But although we are allowed to change the value, we are not allowed to change the kind of value. The name &quot;x&quot; must always have the same kind of value throughout the phrase to which it belongs, so the following will not be allowed:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">let x be 45;
<br>change x to &quot;Norway&quot;;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(The difference between &quot;let&quot; and &quot;change&quot; is that &quot;let&quot; can create a new temporary variable, whereas &quot;change&quot; can only alter one which already exists: on the other hand, &quot;change&quot; can change many other things as well, whereas &quot;let&quot; applies only to temporary variables.)

<table border=0 bgcolor="#e0e0e0" width=100%><tr><td><font face="lucida grande,geneva,arial,tahoma,verdana,helvetica,helv" size=2><a name="e144"><a href=doc147.html#e144><img border=0 src=../FlipOpen.png></a> <font color="#800000"><b>Example</b> (**).</font> <i>More on using kinds of value inside phrases, this time to simulate something new: a box which, although it cannot be picked up, can be pushed around between three different places on the floor.</i><p>
<p>
<p>The strategy is to make the three possible positions of the box into values.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('Box position is a kind of value. The box positions are over by the window, under the shelf and near the bookcase. The current box position is a box position that varies.\n\nTo shove the box to (destination - a box position):\n\tsay &quot;With some effort, you shove the old box from [current box position] to [destination].&quot;;\n\tchange the current box position to the destination.\n\n\n')"><img border=0 src=paste.png></a> Box position is a kind of value. The box positions are over by the window, under the shelf and near the bookcase. The current box position is a box position that varies.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To shove the box to (destination - a box position):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;With some effort, you shove the old box from [current box position] to [destination].&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;change the current box position to the destination.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>So, for instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">shove the box to over by the window;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>might result in the following on screen:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">With some effort, you shove the old box from under the shelf to over by the window.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And we can write conditions like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the current box position is over by the window then...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Using a new kind of value is a good way to set up simulations like this one because Inform will ensure that the &quot;current box position&quot; always, no matter what we do, holds one of the three legal box positions. Similarly, a line like
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the current box position is green then ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>will be disallowed because box positions and colours are incomparable.
