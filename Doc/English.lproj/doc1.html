<p>
<p>Welcome to Inform 7, a design system for interactive fiction based on natural language.
<p>
<p>Interactive fiction is a literary form which involves programming a computer so that it presents a reader with a text which can be explored. Inform aims to make the burden of learning to program such texts as light as possible, and moreover to live up to Donald Knuth's doctrine (&quot;Literate Programming&quot;, 1981) that:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">Programming is best regarded as the process of creating works of literature, which are meant to be read... so we ought to address them to people, not to machines.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>This new release of Inform is a radical departure from most previous approaches to interactive fiction, though in some ways it harks back to early work on AI such as &quot;SHRDLU&quot;, and it is still experimental.
<p>
<p>These notes aim to be concise. They are arranged so that the reader can, in principle, write whole works of fiction as early as the end of Chapter 2. Each subsequent chapter then extends the range of techniques available to make livelier and more intriguing situations.
<p>
<p>Inform 7 is very different from Inform 6, which newcomers will not need to know anything about. For information about Inform 6, please turn to <a href=http://www.inform-fiction.org/>www.inform-fiction.org</a>.
