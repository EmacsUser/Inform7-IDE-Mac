<p>
<p>Nouns and adjectives can be fairly freely mixed:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">supporter = <i>the noun</i> supporter
<br>closed = <i>the adjective</i> closed
<br>the open wine cask = <i>the adjective</i> open + <i>the noun</i> wine cask
<br>something portable = <i>the noun</i> something + <i>the adjective</i> portable
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>What we are not allowed is to have more than one noun in the same description (something English occasionally does allow as a coded form of emphasis, as in &quot;the man Jenkins&quot; or &quot;the harlot Helen&quot;).
<p>
<p>Nouns are simple enough, referring either to kinds or specific things. The noun &quot;something&quot; is no exception: it means &quot;some thing&quot;, so is actually a reference to the kind &quot;thing&quot;. Adjectives are more complicated, come from several different sources, and are not always universally available, as we shall see.
