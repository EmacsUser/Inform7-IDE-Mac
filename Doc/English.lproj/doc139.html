<p>It is quite allowed for a scene to be linked to several other scenes, and this is useful if several alternate strands of plot are being brought together in a common resolution scene:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Bittersweet Ending begins when Stranger's Rejection ends.
<br>Bittersweet Ending begins when Stranger's Acceptance ends.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>and we can also have the same scene beginning when a condition holds. In general, it will begin the first time it gets any chance to do so. More surprisingly, it will begin again as soon after it ends as it can. All scenes repeat themselves, if given the chance.
<p>
<p>This is intentional, and can be useful. Suppose the train calls not once only, but every twenty minutes. We could set this up with two scenes linked back to back like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Train Wait begins when play begins.
<br>Train Stop begins when Train Wait ends.
<br>Train Wait begins when Train Stop ends.
</font></blockquote><p>
