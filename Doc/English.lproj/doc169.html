<p>The following example creates two new relations, and two new verbs, in order to set up a tangled web of intrigue. A number of sleuths (the player among them) find themselves aboard the Orient Express, where a murder has taken place, and one of them is apparently the culprit. Naturally they do not agree on whom, but there is physical evidence which may change their minds:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Dining Car is a room. Lord Peter is a man in the Dining Car. Sherlock Holmes is a man in the Dining Car. Miss Marple is a woman in the Dining Car. Adam Dalgliesh is a man in the Dining Car.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Suspecting relates various people to one person.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The verb to suspect (he suspects, they suspect, he suspected, it is suspected) implies the suspecting relation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Dalgliesh suspects Holmes. Holmes suspects Lord Peter. Lord Peter suspects Holmes. Miss Marple suspects the player.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Exculpating relates one thing to various people.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The verb to exculpate (it exculpates, they exculpate, it exculpated, he is exculpated) implies the exculpating relation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The pipe ash exculpates Holmes. The poison pen letter exculpates Lord Peter. The poison pen letter exculpates Miss Marple. [Poor Dalgliesh. I guess he did it.]
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The pipe ash, the letter and the silver bullet are carried.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Given this, we can then set up elaborate rules:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of showing something to a person who suspects the player:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;'You would say that,' remarks [the second noun] darkly.&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of showing something which exculpates the player to someone:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;'How striking!' says [the second noun]. 'Almost I begin to distrust myself.'&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And so on: &quot;if Dalgliesh suspects someone who is exculpated by something carried by the player...&quot;, for instance, makes a fitting final example for this chapter. The description
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">someone who is exculpated by something carried by the player
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>expresses a complicated idea in very few words, and in such a way that a passer-by looking at the source text would immediately see what was meant.
<p>
<p>The moral is that relations allow sophisticated patterns of behaviour to be created in a way that reads back naturally as English.
