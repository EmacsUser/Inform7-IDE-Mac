<p>
<p>This seems a useful point to clarify something already seen. We normally call a property with a value something like:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">the printed name of the West Ballroom</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>We are sometimes allowed to omit the &quot;of the ...&quot; part, and simply call it &quot;the printed name&quot;, for the sake of brevity. For instance, the following room description:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">The West Ballroom is a room. &quot;A handsome sweep of chequered floor beckons the eye into the [printed name].&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>will result in &quot;West Ballroom&quot; being substituted for &quot;[printed name]&quot;. Since the text belongs to the West Ballroom, that is assumed to be the owner of any properties named in its description. Similarly:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of examining something, say &quot;Hmm, let me see: [printed name]...&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>Here the owner of the &quot;printed name&quot; is assumed to be the noun referred to in the action - in other words, the &quot;something&quot; alluded to in the rule.
