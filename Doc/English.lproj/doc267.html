<p>
<p>Another small discrepancy between assertions and conditions turns up if we ask a surprisingly difficult question: what does &quot;is&quot; mean? There was much amusement when this became an issue in the absurd Senate trial of President Clinton, but the definition of &quot;to be&quot; spans a heroic twelve columns in the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>. Among the many meanings offered are:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">OED 5a. to have or occupy a place somewhere
<br>OED 9b. to have a place among the things distinguished by a specified quality
<br>OED 10. to exist as the thing known by a certain name; to be identical with
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>All three of these are used by Inform:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">OED 5a. The cargo trunk is in the attic.
<br>OED 9b. The cargo trunk is an openable container.
<br>OED 10. if the noun is the cargo trunk ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>OED meanings 5a and 9b are not really very different as far as Inform is concerned: they both say that something belongs to some larger class of things. &quot;The cargo trunk is in the attic&quot; means that the trunk is one among the things in the attic; &quot;the cargo trunk is an openable container&quot; means that it is among the openable containers. (In computer programming terms this is a sort of matching operator, like &quot;=~&quot; in the Perl scripting language.) On the other hand, OED meaning 10 is very different. If somebody reads out a line of code from the C programming language,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if (x == 7) ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>they will probably say the words &quot;If x is 7&quot;: here, the &quot;is&quot; means &quot;equals&quot;.
<p>
<p>So &quot;X is Y&quot; has two essentially different meanings to Inform: &quot;X matches Y&quot; and &quot;X equals Y&quot;. Both can be used in conditions, but only the first can be used in assertions. That is why Inform will reject the assertion
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The cargo trunk is the oak tree.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(which must be a lie) even though it will allow exactly the same sentence structure in a condition:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the noun is the oak tree...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This all sounds like a pedantic digression, and perhaps it is. (An OED 9b &quot;is&quot;, by the way.) But it has a moral: that &quot;is&quot; can do far more than the simple value comparisons offered by most computer programming languages.
