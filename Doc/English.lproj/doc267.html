Inverted assertions</b></td></tr></table><p>
<p>
<p>Because of a curious irregularity in English, it is not quite true that every assertion could also be used as a condition.
<p>
<p>The irregularity is that we sometimes reverse a sentence so that what Inform would call the Verb is split up. For instance,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">In the Garden is a sunflower.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This does not follow the pattern S = DP + VP, because &quot;in the garden&quot; is not a DP: indeed, it is not a noun at all. To make sense of this sentence, Inform reverses it so that it does fit the pattern:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A sunflower is in the Garden.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This allows a whole load of new sentences which our grammar does not at present fit, and we can widen our grammar by adding the following rule:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">6. S = RP is/are DP
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>But we need to remember that only assertions can do this, so &quot;if in the garden is a sunflower...&quot; is not allowed as a condition.
<p>
<p>(This quirk of English is called subject-verb inversion: see the <i>Oxford English Grammar</i> at 3.22F.)
