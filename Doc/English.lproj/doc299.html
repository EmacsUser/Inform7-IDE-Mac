<p><i>What goes wrong:</i>
<p>
<p>
<p>Before we have done anything else:
<p>
<p>>x form
<p>The alien disposal form is yours to fill out, and currently it reads as follows:
<p>
<p>PLEASE CLEARLY RECORD CREATURE CHARACTERISTICS:
<p>
<p>Color: red
<p>
<p>Hostility: hostile
<p>
<p>Sex: M
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p><i>Comments:</i>
<p>
<p>
<p>If I do something like [if we have taken the form] instead, then the fields are properly blank at the outset of the game. I've checked the action index and it obviously does know what the proper past tenses of these verbs are, so I am not quite sure where it's going wrong.
<p>
<p>Or possibly it is not a bug, but I am just too tired to see why not...
