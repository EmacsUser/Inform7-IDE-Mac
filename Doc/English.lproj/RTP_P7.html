<b>P7 - Too many rulebooks</b>
<p>
<p>Most problems are detected when Inform translates the source text, but this is one of the exceptions, a "run-time problem" which emerges only during play.

There is no limit to the number of rulebooks which can exist in a given work, and there are typically several hundred. However, only 20 can be active at any given moment.<p>Rulebooks typically pile up when the rules governing one action call for another action to take place first, since action-processing is the most intensive use for rulebooks. If the limit is hit, this is usually a symptom of a circularity mistake - where an action is directly or indirectly duplicating itself. For instance, <font color="#000080"><b>Before going north, try going north.</b></font> has this effect.
