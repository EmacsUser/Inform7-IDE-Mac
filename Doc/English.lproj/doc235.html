<p>
<p>There are times when it is not convenient to write a suitable &quot;for ...&quot; rule, or when we cannot be bothered. For such times we are allowed to write:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">begin the analysing activity with the pitchblende;
<br>...
<br>end the analysing activity with the pitchblende;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>but we need to be careful to follow three golden rules: all activities must end, they must never last longer than a turn, and if activity B starts during activity A then it must also finish during activity A. We must also be careful to make sure that if an activity applies to something, then it begins and ends with the same something (the pitchblende, in the above example).
<p>
<p>The before rules are considered at the time of the &quot;begin ...&quot; phrase; the after rules at the &quot;end ...&quot;. What, then, of the &quot;for&quot; rules? In the above setup, they would simply be ignored. But we can make them effectual like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">begin the analysing activity with the pitchblende;
<br>...
<br>if handling the analysing activity with the pitchblende begin;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
<br>end if;
<br>...
<br>end the analysing activity with the pitchblende;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The &quot;for&quot; rules are invoked when the &quot;handling ...&quot; test is carried out: the condition is true only if no rule has intervened. Thus we should place the activity's normal behaviour inside the &quot;if&quot;.
