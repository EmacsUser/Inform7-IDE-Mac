<p><i>Reported by:</i> Emily Short <emshort@mindspring.com> / <i>Date:</i> 30 September 2005
<p>
<p><i>Nature:</i> The source looks legal and produces a playable game, but 	  the game does not do what it should
<p>
<p><i>Build:</i> 2Z30
<p>
<p><i>Platform:</i> Mac OS X
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p><i>Code example:</i>
<p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('Relations\n\n\n\n\n')"><img border=0 src=paste.png></a> Relations
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>

<p><i>What goes wrong:</i>
<p>
<p>
<p>>hint
<p>** hint
<p>Your goal here is not to be caught with evidence of your magical abilities: you're logically in line for power but pragmatically not in a position to seize it, and anything that makes you more of a threat to Tiberius (like demonstrated skill in the imperial Art) will simply get you killed.
<p>
<p>You can look for such evidence is at any time by THINKing. If you aren't quite clear on what your abilities are, and you haven't played any other work in this series, you may want to start by reading the old letter. And if you forget who's who, typing WHO will list the characters you've thought about recently.
<p>
<p>You're also on the clock, so try not to dawdle too much. Thinking, reading or looking at things, taking inventory, etc., are instant actions which cost you nothing; linking and most physical activities are work, though, and will consume a turn each.

<p>There used to be a space before the >. Now there isn't. I don't know why, but I'm not blessing this transcript.
