<p>It may be worth noting in passing that number specifications, like all other kinds of value, can be understood in typed commands. (See the chapter on Understanding for more on what can go in such square brackets.) For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('&quot;America Stands Tall&quot;\n\nThe Oval Office is a room. Josh and Toby are men in the Oval. A height is a kind of value. 5 foot 11 specifies a height. A person has a height. Josh is 5 foot 8. Toby is 5 foot 10.\n\nHeight guessing is an action applying to one thing and one height. Understand &quot;guess [someone] is [height]&quot; as height guessing.\n\nCheck height guessing: if the noun is not a person, say &quot;You can only guess the height of people.&quot; instead. Carry out height guessing: if the height of the noun is the height understood, say &quot;Spot on!&quot;; if the height of the noun is greater than the height understood, say &quot;No, [the noun] is taller than that.&quot;; if the height of the noun is less than the height understood, say &quot;No, [the noun] is shorter than that.&quot;\n\n\n')"><img border=0 src=paste.png></a> &quot;America Stands Tall&quot;
