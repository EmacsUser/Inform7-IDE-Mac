<p>The &quot;photographing&quot; action now works very nicely when the player does it. But not when others try. Suppose that neither the player, not Clark Gable, is holding the camera:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">>photograph clark
<br>You can hardly photograph without a camera, now can you?
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">>clark, photograph me
<br>>
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>An uncanny silence. What has happened is that the rules written so far are all implicitly restricted to the player only. This is because when we write -
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Check photographing: if the camera is not carried then say &quot;You can hardly photograph without a camera, now can you?&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>the action is &quot;photographing&quot;, not &quot;Clark trying photographing&quot;. In the next few sections we shall see how to make the rules work nicely for everybody. This is a little bit harder, so it should be noted right away that in many projects there is no need. In a game which has no other characters who succumb to persuasion, for instance, only the player will ever try the action.

<p>
<p>Inform has built-in commands for other people, and sometimes we may want to adjust the way these work without completely disabling and replacing the command. Suppose, for instance, that instead of
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Kermit the Frog looks through his possessions.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>we'd like someone taking inventory to report what he's got, thus:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Kermit the Frog says, &quot;I seem to be carrying a microphone and wearing a hat and a trenchcoat.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>To do this, we could replace the built-in report rule with a different one.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('&quot;Trying Taking Manhattan&quot;\n\nProcedural rule: substitute the loud inventory rule for the report other people taking inventory rule.\n\nThis is the loud inventory rule:\n\tif the player is the person asked, do nothing;\n\totherwise say &quot;[The person asked] says, \'I seem to be carrying [list of things carried by the person asked][if the person asked is wearing something] and wearing [list of things worn by the person asked][end if].\'&quot;\n\nPersuasion rule for asking someone to try doing something: persuasion succeeds.\n\nGrand Central Station is a room. &quot;Here you are in New York, New York.
