<p>As Chapter 5 has already discussed, Inform looks at a whole range of &quot;relations&quot; between objects, many of which we can change. The general rule is as follows. Suppose S is a sentence about a relationship between things. Then there are three things we can do with S:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">S. - The relation holds at the start of play.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if S, ...; - Does the relation hold right now?
<br>now S; - Make the relation hold from now on.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>For instance,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The apple is in the basket.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the apple is in the basket, ...;
<br>now the apple is in the basket;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The effect of &quot;now the apple is in the basket&quot; is identical to &quot;move the apple to the basket&quot;, so this appears to offer nothing new; and &quot;now&quot; duplicates other things already available, too, because &quot;now the oaken door is open&quot; does the same thing as &quot;change the oaken door to open&quot;. But &quot;now&quot; is more general and more flexible. For instance,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">now the top hat is worn by Mr Darcy;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>will make the hat worn, rather than simply carried, by Darcy: this is something which could not be done with the &quot;move&quot; phrase. We can also apply &quot;now&quot; to many things at once:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">now all the doors are open;
<br>now all of the things in the sack are in the box;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The second of these moves the entire contents of the sack to the box.
