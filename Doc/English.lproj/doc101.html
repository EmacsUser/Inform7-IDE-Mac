<p>Some things will occasionally be in a limbo state called being &quot;out of play&quot;: like chess pieces which have been taken, or cards not yet dealt, they wait on the sidelines, perhaps to be needed again, perhaps not. Anything created with no apparent location will start the game out of play, as in the case of the lamp here:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Aladdin's Cave is a room. The genie's lamp is a container.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>To move something back into play, we simply &quot;move&quot; it back onto the board, so to speak: back to a room, or to something else which is currently in play. To remove something, we use the phrase:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">remove the gold coin from play
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(We are not permitted to remove rooms, or the player, from play.) We can test whether something is in play with
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the gold coin is somewhere ...
</font></blockquote><p>
