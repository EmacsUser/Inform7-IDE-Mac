<p>
<p>This preview release of Inform 7 runs on Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther) through the graphical user interface created by Andrew Hunter.
<p>
<p>The main window has two areas side by side, and the wall between them can be dragged back and forth, like the slide on a trombone. Each side can display one of a number of displays relevant to the current project, called &quot;panels&quot;, one of them being the Documentation panel visible now. The vertical strip of choices at the right hand edge of each side allows you to choose between panels. (The same panel can be showing on both sides, if that's useful.)
<p>
<p>At the start the only panels available are a blank page in which to write the first lines of a new interactive fiction - the Source panel - and this one, the Documentation. Clicking on the other choices will do nothing.
<p>
<p>The exception is the &quot;Settings&quot; panel, which contains some preference settings for the individual project - not the whole application. This is always available, but it controls settings which can be left alone almost all of the time.
