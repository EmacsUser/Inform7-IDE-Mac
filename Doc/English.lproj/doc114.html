<p>Special testing verbs, like &quot;test&quot; and &quot;rules&quot;, are automatically excluded from the game if it is compiled as a Release version. We sometimes want to write our own for-testing-purposes-only code, though, and for this purpose we are allowed to designate whole headings as being &quot;not for release&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Section 10 - Open sesame - Not for release
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Universal opening is an action applying to nothing.
<br>Understand &quot;open sesame&quot; as universal opening.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out universal opening:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with item running through doors begin;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;change item to open;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end repeat.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report universal opening: say &quot;Open Sesame!&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Clearly we do not wish the final reader to be able to type &quot;open sesame&quot;, so this whole heading will be disregarded in the Release version, as will any heading whose name includes &quot;not for release&quot;.
<p>
<p>Note that if a chapter, say, is marked as &quot;not for release&quot;, then its subheadings (mere sections) will also not be for release. If in doubt, check the &quot;Contents&quot; index: if any section is &quot;not for release&quot; then so are all of its subheadings.
<p>
<p><i>[At present the Release button does not run the NI compiler with the &quot;-release&quot; switch set, so the exclusion won't actually happen yet, but it's all working at the NI end. The next version of the Inform.app OS X application will fix this.]</i>
