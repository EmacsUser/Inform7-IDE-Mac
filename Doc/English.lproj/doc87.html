<p>
<p>We often need code which does one thing in one circumstance, and another the rest of the time. We could do this like so:
<p>
<blockquote>if N is 2 begin; ...; end if;
<br>if N is not 2 begin; ...; end if;
</blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>but this is not very elegant, and besides, what if the action we take when N is 2 changes N so that it becomes something else?
<p>
<p>Instead we use &quot;otherwise&quot;:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">if N is 2 begin;<br>...;<br>otherwise;<br>...;<br>end if;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>Note that there is only one &quot;end if&quot;: the &quot;otherwise&quot; phrase occurs inside the &quot;if ... end if&quot; block of phrases.
<p>
<p>When there is only a single phrase we can use the shortened form:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">if N is 2 then say &quot;Hooray, N is 2!&quot;;<br>otherwise say &quot;Boo, N is not 2...&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>(In almost every computer programming language ever devised, including previous versions of Inform, the word &quot;else&quot; is used rather than &quot;otherwise&quot;: for the sake of familiarity, &quot;else&quot; can also be used here. All the same, &quot;otherwise&quot; seems closer to natural English.)
