<p>
<p>We can also reckon the number of consecutive turns on which an action has been repeated, by talking about &quot;turns&quot; instead of &quot;times&quot;, as demonstrated in the following example game. Note also that we are allowed to use the phrase &quot;doing it&quot; to mean &quot;the same description as the previous one except for the part about turns or times&quot;, like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Waiting Room&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Antechamber is a room. The tattered copy of Women's Wear Daily is in the Antechamber. Instead of taking the Daily, say &quot;It is stamped NOT TO BE TAKEN AWAY.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of examining the Daily for the first time, say &quot;The best article seems to be about how your star sign affects your best swimsuit colour. Really: that's the best article.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of doing it for the second time, say &quot;You now know a generous amount about a typical week in the life of a weather forecaster.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of doing it for the third time, say &quot;You would now know how to cook herb bread, except that you have already forgotten the names of both of the herbs.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of doing it more than three times, say &quot;Nope, you've drained it of all conceivable sustenance, even the small ads about French farmhouses to let (sleeps 7) and breast reduction surgery (with alarming photographs in sallow light).&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After waiting for four to six turns, say &quot;This is getting mighty dull.&quot; After waiting for seven to eight turns, say &quot;Really, exceptionally dull.&quot; After waiting for nine turns, end the game saying &quot;You have died of boredom, something previously thought medically impossible&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
