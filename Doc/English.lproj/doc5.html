<p>Designing an interactive fiction can be divided into two related activities. One is the creation of the world as it appears at the start of play: where and what everything is, and how the different locations connect together. Given this alone, Inform would create nothing more than a simulation: the player will be able to explore, move things around and carry out a limited number of mundane tasks (unlocking doors, say, or switching on lights) but nothing surprising will happen. No lost keys will be found in the bellies of fish, nor will anything spontaneous happen. The second aspect of design, then, will be describing the unusual things which happen: the rules of play which liven things up.
<p>
<p>The same division into two is visible in Inform source text. Some of the sentences make unconditional factual statements about the world: for example,
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">The wood-slatted crate is in the Gazebo. The crate is a container.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>Inform calls sentences like this one &quot;assertions&quot;. The verb is almost always &quot;is&quot; (or &quot;are&quot;), written in the present tense. The world described is the starting condition of the game: what happens when play begins is another matter. The crate will always be a container, but if somebody picks it up and walks off with it then it will no longer be in the Gazebo.
<p>
<p>The other kind of sentence tells Inform what should happen in certain circumstances, and reads like an instruction issued to someone:
<p>
<p><blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of taking the crate, say &quot;It's far too heavy to lift.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<p>This is a &quot;rule&quot;, and it changes the crate's behaviour. The player who tries typing &quot;take crate&quot;, &quot;pick up the crate&quot; or similar will be met only with the unhelpful reply &quot;It's far too heavy to lift.&quot;
<p>
<p>Inform is built on a mass of several hundred rules, some quite complex, and it could even be said that Inform <i>is</i> that mass of rules. We never see the complexity behind the scenes because the whole aim is to provide a basic, penny-plain, vanilla flavoured sort of realism. It would be surprising if one could put the crate inside itself, so a rule exists to forbid this. It would be surprising if one could drop something which was already on the ground, and so on. This is all done for us.
