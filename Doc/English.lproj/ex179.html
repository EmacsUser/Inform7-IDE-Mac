<p>Some of the examples in the last few sections were slightly strained because they used numbers where an English speaker not quite do so. We tend not to say &quot;Isabella has height 68&quot;: we would more normally say &quot;Isabella is 5 foot 8.&quot; Perhaps the computer will need to store that measurement as the number 68 in some register or other, but we really don't want to know that.
<p>
<p>Inform allows us to create new, basically numerical kinds of value, like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A weight is a kind of value. 10kg specifies a weight.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>By contrast, the kinds of value seen so far have been set up thus:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A colour is a kind of value. The colours are red, green and blue.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We can choose to make a new kind of value of either variety, but we can't mix the two in the same kind: it will either be numerical at heart (&quot;10kg&quot;) or verbal at heart (&quot;blue&quot;).
<p>
<p>The effect of &quot;10kg specifies a weight&quot; is to tell Inform that text matching this form is a constant value of kind &quot;weight&quot;. So, for instance,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The maximum load is a weight that varies. The maximum load is 8000kg.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the maximum load <= 8000kg, ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Weights behave just like numbers in the ways we can compare them: but Inform respects the fact that a weight is not just any number, so it would not allow us to compare (say) &quot;8000kg&quot; and &quot;5 foot 8&quot;. Weights can meaningfully be compared only with other weights.
<p>
<p>We can also say weights:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Weighbridge is a room. &quot;A sign declares that the maximum load is [maximum load].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>...which will produce the text &quot;A sign declares that the maximum load is 8000kg.&quot;
