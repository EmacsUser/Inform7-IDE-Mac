<p>Adjectives are often used in English to give a sense of where something is on a sliding scale. We talk about &quot;a tall man&quot; and &quot;a short man&quot;, but without meaning that all men are either tall or short. If pushed, we might say that tall means about 6 feet and up, short means about 5 feet 6 and down, but we more often compare one person's height against another's.
<p>
<p>Inform allows us to use adjectives in the same way. For example, every container has a number called its &quot;carrying capacity&quot;. We can define:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: A container is huge if its carrying capacity is 20 or more.
<br>Definition: A container is large if its carrying capacity is 10 or more.
<br>Definition: A container is standard if its carrying capacity is 7.
<br>Definition: A container is small if its carrying capacity is 5 or less.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>These definitions are similar to those in the previous section, but have a very specific (and strictly enforced) shape to them. The adjective must be a single word. We have to say &quot;its&quot; (i.e., of it), not the ungrammatical &quot;it's&quot;; we have to specify a property, and a literal value of it, and we must either give an exact value or else conclude with &quot;or more&quot; or &quot;or less&quot;. If we create something with one of these properties:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The basket is a large container in the Shop. The thimble is a small container in the Shop. The matchbox is a standard container in the Shop.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>then they will have the most moderate values they can have, that is, the basket will have carrying capacity 10 and the thimble 5 (and of course the matchbox 7). The following tests will then, not surprisingly, fail:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the basket is huge ...
<br>if the basket is a small container ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>because the basket is neither huge nor small, but somewhere in between.
<p>
<p>Sometimes the meaning of adjectives must depend on their context, as we see from the following example, where we assess heights in inches:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A person has a number called height. Definition: A man is tall if his height is 72 or more. Definition: A woman is tall if her height is 68 or more.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Inform then judges whether someone is or is not &quot;tall&quot; using different standards for men and for women, and
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">In the Shop are a tall man and a tall woman.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>creates a man 72 inches tall and a woman 68 inches tall.
