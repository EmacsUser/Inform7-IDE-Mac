<p>There are missing third-party actions, to do with Clark's singing career.
<p>
<p>Liquids are still not implemented. We have an example for ropes (&quot;Otranto&quot;), but still, it is conceivable that some sort of &quot;anchoring&quot; behaviour might be viable, and this might or might not be related to liquids.

<blockquote><font color="#000080">This is big, and it is closely connected with some of the parsing issues. I would be marvelously pleased if we could acquire the functionality of zarf's demo thingy, at least as regards mixing and notional objects. I am not particularly wedded to the enumeration of objects. [ES]

<p>Directions other than the standard cardinals cannot now be created, though they can be imitated.
<p>
<p>Should time be more mutable, so that actions can - if they choose - specify that no time passes, after all? If so, to what extent? Do they become exempt from &quot;after&quot; routines? Do they count towards &quot;... for the third turn&quot; tallies? Emily says: if we have a check rule
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;You try to pull the tag off the mattress, but it won't come.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>then time should reasonably have passed for the player; whereas if instead we say
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;Are you crazy? The tag says DO NOT REMOVE THIS TAG!&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>the nature of the refusal is such that no time should pass. (Note: I was mostly thinking we would turn off time passing when we refused to finish actions, not when they were deemed to be successful -- that is, at check, not at carry-out. [ES])
