<p>&quot;There&quot;, as in: if there is an open door in the Chamber, ... This exists already for table cells, so it seems unnatural that it doesn't for general predicates.

<p>Arithmetic phrases:
<blockquote><font color="#000080">add <...> to <...>
<br>subtract <...> from <...>,
<br>etc.

<p>
<p>Testing particular endings of scenes:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of smelling when Scorching Onions has ended horribly:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;The scent of the late disaster lingers in the air.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Paragraph sorting in room descriptions.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">This is conceptually, even if not in execution, related to the name-printing issues, and to my idea about having the list writer allow for some internal ordering of the list. Again we are trying to allow the author to do some structuring of how the output text reflects the world model, by indicating (among other things) what is important, what is of ordinary relevance, and what should be suppressed. An object can be important and therefore moved for reasons of art to the first or last place in the room description; a property or relation can be important and therefore mentioned in the object name; an object or property or relation can be as yet unknown, and therefore kept secret until the player has done the right things to uncover it.[ES]

<p>Are we now happy with the &quot;pair of gloves&quot; problem, Richard Tucker's yardstick for the adequacy of an IF design system?
<p>
<p>I still think a list of non-standard past participles and plurals would be a plus, but am beginning to think this is only because I would enjoy putting the feature in.

<p>Emily says:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">My fingers itch for access to the number-printing part as well. It would be nifty if I could write something to say &quot;when you're printing the plural name of more than 10 things, just say &quot;lots of&quot; rather than the exact number&quot;; or &quot;when printing the plural name of two geese, say the number as &quot;brace&quot;&quot;.

<p>
<p>An activity for the &quot;(empty and unlit)&quot;, etc., text after items in lists. (Free-form, or should we allow the user to specify properties which are always listed: or both?) Having been through one hand, Emily writes:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The other says to back off a minute from the formal structure inherited from I6; cross my eyes, channel Nick Montfort; and point out that the real task before us is not &quot;do post-listing&quot; but &quot;generate a phrase which describes object foo with all the information about foo that is relevant to the context&quot;. So what's interesting is
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">(A) To identify what about the object needs to be specified at any given point. The current model assumes these qualities are containment/support, openness, and provision of light -- we're looking at information that could be either a property or a relation. One can imagine a game in which the player wants other types of relation to be specified (&quot;allied with Marie de Medici&quot; instead of &quot;containing fermented fish sauce&quot;) or other properties (&quot;hot&quot;, &quot;silver&quot;, etc.); wants them to be specified at some times and not at others (when the goggles are worn, when the NPC has been introduced); wants them to be specified in some contexts and not in others (when listing inventory only). The framework of activities does make it easy to imagine how we might write such rules, assuming a form to say &quot;reveal the openness property&quot; or whatever.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">(B) To figure out how to glue all that together into an appropriate phrase. I suspect that as a rule one would want properties to go before the name (&quot;empty&quot;, &quot;open&quot;, &quot;hot&quot;, &quot;made of brass&quot;) and relations after (&quot;under the sofa&quot;, &quot;married to John Lennon&quot;). However. I appreciate that A is annoyingly open-ended and that this means B is likely to be hell, and I wouldn't blame you for throwing up your hands and declaring that before and after name-printing rules are all anyone needs *really*.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">I also think -- though I didn't realize when I brought it up -- that this is likely to be intimately enmeshed with the mass noun problem, because with mass nouns you get items which are specified by their containment relation (&quot;Which do you mean, the tea in the cup or the tea in the pot?&quot;)...
