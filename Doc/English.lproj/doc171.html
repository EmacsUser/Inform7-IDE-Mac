<p>
<p>It is poor form to define with negatives, but the first thing to say about activities is that they are <i>not</i> actions. This needs saying because Inform often seems to treat them as if they are, by allowing us to write rules like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before printing the name of a woman, say &quot;Ms &quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>With this rule in place, someone called &quot;Daphne&quot; will always be described as &quot;Ms Daphne&quot;, and so on. The language looks as if we were imposing a rule on an action called &quot;printing the name of&quot;, but there is no such action: instead, it is an &quot;activity&quot;. To spell out the difference:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">An action is a simulated task for the fictional protagonist.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">An activity is a real task for the computer program doing the simulation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Activities allow us to influence or change some of the standard habits of Inform, using rules as flexible and powerful as those applicable to actions.
