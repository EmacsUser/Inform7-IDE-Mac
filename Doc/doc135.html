<p>
<p>Every extension, including the Standard Rules, has the right to its own set of headings and subheadings, independently of those used by the main source for the work or by any other extension which may be included. So if the extension is divided into four sections and finishes on Section D, say, that doesn't mean that Section D will continue outside the extension as the main source of the game runs on.
<p>
<p>Assuming that the extension never produces any errors, the names of these headings will never be outwardly visible.
