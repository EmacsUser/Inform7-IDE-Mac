		<Description>
			Understand introduces new words and phrases that can be understood by the running game.
			<linebreak/>
			<linebreak/>
			During play, the computer and the player alternate in writing messages to each other: in the player's case, these are short instructions, usually saying what to do next. A wide range of such "commands" are automatically understood, but these only apply to the standard built-in actions. (This wide range is conveniently tabulated at the foot of the Actions index.) If we want the player to be able to command new actions, then we need to specify what is to be understood as what. For this, we supply special sentences starting with the word "Understand".
