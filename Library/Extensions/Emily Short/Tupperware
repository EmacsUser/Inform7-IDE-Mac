Atree surgeon from New Hampshire turned inventor, Tupper wonthe patent in 1947, but found that customers were confusedas to how to operate the seal, and needed practical demonstration.Direct sales were abandoned in 1951 when charismatic singlemother Brownie Wise devised the Tupperware Party and soconverted household America into a cross between the BeakerPeople of the Bronze Age and the Stepford Wives.After his death, Tupper elected to have his body sealed in asix-foot salad crisper, widely believed the largest work ofTupperware then extant. He remains in a giant refridgerator atthe Mt. Rushmore National Park to this day.
